//! tetris_05_lookahead_poc — the owner-directive POC (2026-09-25): stop
//! imitating laya and OUT-PLAY it. Depth-2 lookahead over the next piece
//! ("try every next-next combination, one step ahead of laya"), plus the
//! owner's strategy shaping: deep wells are filled by WHATEVER piece fits
//! (superlinear urgency — the I may never come), and compact placements
//! beat random ones by construction of the evaluation.
//!
//! Three players, one shared terminal-board evaluation (so each delta is
//! isolated):
//! - **ply1-classic**: 1-ply greedy, the Lee-style Dellacherie-class weights.
//! - **ply1-shaped**: 1-ply greedy + the deep-well urgency shaping.
//! - **ply2-shaped**: depth-2 exhaustive lookahead (every current placement ×
//!   every next-piece placement, ~900 evaluated continuations per decision)
//!   + shaping — the "reflexer" candidate.
//!
//! Same seeded 7-bag piece sequence for every player per seed. Real hard
//! drop (`FromTop` — the v3 physics). Guideline scoring (40/100/300/1200).
//!
//! Run: `cargo run --release --example tetris_05_lookahead_poc [-- <games> <cap> <garbage_rows> <fill_pct>]`
//!
//! Recorded context (reflex-site arena, engine `00aa6221`, T12): the fitted
//! modelless head played 140 pts / 3 lines / 46 pieces; laya played
//! 660 pts / 11 lines / 70 pieces @ p50 394 ms per piece. This POC is the
//! search-based answer.
