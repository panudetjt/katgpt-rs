#![cfg(all(feature = "lt2_looped", feature = "cadence_gate"))]
//! Issue 731 T1 — the residual-gated early exit, e2e through the production
//! loop path (EqR action item 7.2, arXiv:2605.21488 Equilibrium Reasoners).
//!
//! The probe's kernel content (the d_min floor, the L = 3 magnitude window,
//! the shape arm via `ConvergenceCadence`, the non-finite policy) is pinned
//! by unit tests inside `crates/katgpt-core/src/convergence_cadence.rs`.
//! This bench proves the COMPOSED behavior on the T1/407 fixture (micro +
//! seed-42 + InterLoopNorm):
//!
//! 1. **G1 (bit-identity, probe present but never firing)** — `Some(probe)`
//!    with an unreachable `d_min` is bit-identical to `None` across all 27
//!    micro-vocab tokens: feeding the probe must not perturb the loop.
//! 2. **Fired-exit ≡ elastic equivalence (bit-level)** — a probe that fires
//!    at completed iteration `k` produces logits bit-identical to
//!    `elastic_loop_override = Some(k)` on the same token (the Issue-698-T4
//!    halt ≡ elastic equivalence, re-proven for the residual exit): the exit
//!    breaks the same loop at the same iteration, nothing else differs.
//! 3. **The d_min floor holds through the real path** — a probe with a large
//!    `tau` (magnitude arm always satisfied once the window fills) cannot
//!    fire before its floor; `fired_at_iteration()` must equal the floor.
//!
//! # Run
