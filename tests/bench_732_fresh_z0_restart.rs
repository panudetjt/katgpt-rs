#![cfg(feature = "eqr_convergence")]
//! Issue 732 — Fresh-z₀ breadth-restart arm + the D-first law for
//! best_of_k_rollouts (EqR randomized-initialization axis, Research 079 §10).
//!
//! # Pre-registered design (committed BEFORE the run — the Issue-073-T3 order)
//!
//! ## The gap (issue text, verbatim input)
//!
//! Breadth today = per-rollout SDE noise (γ) around the SAME base marginals —
//! low-variance perturbation inside one basin. EqR's RI axis: independent
//! restarts from FRESH random z₀ (Gaussian, large σ) probing DIFFERENT
//! basins. On shaped landscapes `Top1Converged` beats majority vote; on
//! unshaped ones it can lose (convergence certifies basin membership, not
//! correctness).
//!
//! ## Arms (the full restart × selection grid, matched NFE)
//!
//! RestartMode ∈ {Perturb (γ = 1.0), FreshZ0 (σ = 4.0)} × WidthSelectionMode
//! ∈ {MostFrequent, BestQ, Top1Converged} — six arms, K ∈ {1, 4, 8, 16, 32},
//! 20 trials (seeds 42..61, the bench_119 convention). NFE = D·K per call;
//! all arms share the K grid at each D, so comparisons are NFE-matched by
//! construction. Config::draft() fixture (seed-42 weights, dflash marginals,
//! greedy baseline) — the same unshaped synthetic fixture as bench_119.
//!
//! ## Pre-registered invariants (hard asserts)
//!
//! 1. **K = 1 anchor:** every arm takes the single-rollout early return —
//!    all six arms must return the SAME path per trial. (CORRECTED before
//!    any arm metric was produced: the first draft asserted equality with
//!    the GREEDY path — wrong assumption about the host: at K = 1 with SDE
//!    enabled, `best_of_k_rollouts` still injects γ-noise into the single
//!    rollout, so the path is the NOISED single-tree path, not the greedy
//!    one. The anchor that matters for NFE-matched comparison is
//!    arm-equality, which is what this assert now pins.)
//! 2. **Replay determinism:** same seed twice → identical path (every arm at
//!    K = 16).
//! 3. **Mechanism check:** FreshZ0 must diversify — the cross-trial unique
//!    returned-path count for FreshZ0 ≥ Perturb's at K = 16 (σ = 4.0 distorts
//!    rankings more than γ = 1.0; if FreshZ0 cannot even match Perturb's
//!    diversity, the axis is not exercising).
//!
//! ## Pre-registered expectations (MEASURED, not asserted — the T2/731
//! precedent; the verdicts are printed and recorded in the issue)
//!
//! - **Negative control (T3):** on this UNSHAPED fixture, Perturb+Top1Converged
//!   must NOT beat Perturb+MostFrequent on quality or top-1 agreement. A win
//!   indicts the fixture, not the method — the control guards the main
//!   comparison's interpretation.
//! - **Main comparison (T2):** FreshZ0+Top1Converged vs Perturb+MostFrequent
//!   at matched K — Δ quality and Δ agreement recorded per K. EqR predicts
//!   fresh restarts + convergence selection win ABOVE a depth knee; below it,
//!   breadth is useless.
//! - **D-first law (T4):** D ∈ {2, 4, 8} — draft_lookahead is capped by
//!   block_size = 16 and the greedy baseline is meaningless at D = 1, so the
//!   issue's {1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 64} grid is measured as {2, 4, 8} on this
//!   fixture (DEVIATION recorded: D = 16 collapses to 8 effective depths via
//!   `min(draft_lookahead, block_size − pos)`; D = 64 is unreachable on
//!   Config::draft()). For each (D, arm): the smallest K whose mean agreement
//!   beats K = 1 by > 1e-4 — the breadth-pays threshold; the law sentence is
//!   read off the table after the run.
//!
//! # Run
