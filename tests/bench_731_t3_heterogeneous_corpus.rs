//! Issue 731 T3 — the heterogeneous-depth corpora + the G2 GOAT gate.
//!
//! # Why (the T2 implication, verbatim input to this design)
//!
//! T2 measured the single-token micro fixture: the settle signal leads the
//! output knee by ~4 iters, every τ ≤ 3 fires 27/27 at median k = 6, and the
//! quality at k = 6 (0.051) misses the 0.01 knee bound — only a knee-scale
//! `d_min` (= 10, the recorded post-hoc lever) reaches knee parity, where the
//! probe reduces to a static knee-pinned floor with straggler adaptivity. A
//! static override is therefore EQUIVALENT on that fixture, and G2's
//! differentiated value cannot be demonstrated. G2 needs inputs that settle at
//! genuinely different depths: easy inputs (knee ~4–8) and hard inputs
//! (knee ≥ 12) in the SAME corpus, so a per-input-safe static override must
//! run deep for everyone while the probe exits each input at its own settle
//! point.
//!
//! # Common protocol (all corpora; the Issue-073-T3 order — every corpus
//! pre-registered in a commit BEFORE its run)
//!
//! - Weight fixture: the T1/T2 convention — `Config::micro()` + seed-42 +
//!   `HybridPattern::Uniform` + `HlaMode::Ahla` +
//!   `LoopMode::WeightShared { loop_count: R_REF = 32 }`.
//! - **Per-input isolation:** each input is evaluated with its sequence
//!   prefix (positions < p) run at the NATURAL depth, and only the input's
//!   own position carries the probe or the fixed-k override. Cross-position
//!   exit compounding is the DEPLOYMENT reality but is excluded here —
//!   per-input attribution is the thing G2 needs; composition is riir-ai
//!   Issue 881's territory (recorded non-goal).
//! - Per-input reference: logits at the full R_REF = 32 depth.
//! - Per-input quality: cosine distance to the input's OWN reference.
//! - Per-input knee: first k in K_GRID with dist_i(k) ≤ 0.01; `undefined` if
//!   no grid k qualifies by 32.
//! - **Probe config (a-priori transfer — NOT re-tuned, ever, across all
//!   corpora):** `LoopResidualExit::new(tau = 1.0, d_min = 10)` — T2's
//!   recorded knee-parity lever. The transfer itself is part of the test.
//! - **Invariants (hard asserts):** G1 — a fed-but-never-firing probe
//!   (`d_min = usize::MAX`) is bit-identical to `None` on every input;
//!   exit ≡ elastic bit-identity for every fired input; the InterLoopNorm
//!   negative control at the T2-AMENDED boundary — every τ ≤ 3 fires ZERO
//!   inputs on the same corpus content with the stability mode swapped.
//! - **The G2 verdict (measured, not asserted):** `cut = 32 / median_all`
//!   (median over ALL inputs of iterations-used: fired k, or 32 for
//!   ran-to-32). **PASS iff cut ≥ 2× AND corpus-mean dist at exit ≤ 0.01.**
//!   p95/p99 fired depth with tail support (percentile-index discipline).
//!
//! # The sanity-bar record (read before interpreting any verdict here)
//!
//! The bar's PURPOSE, stated in the v1 pre-registration: the corpus counts as
//! heterogeneous-depth when "a per-input-safe static override must run deep
//! for everyone while the probe exits each input at its own settle point" —
//! i.e. the ADAPTIVITY MARGIN `K*/median_all ≥ 2` (K* = the corpus-safe
//! static depth: the smallest grid k with max_i dist_i(k) ≤ 0.01; degraded
//! form K* := 32 when the bound is unreachable by 32 with ≤ 10% undefined).
//! The v1/v2 pre-registrations instead encoded a PROXY for that purpose —
//! frac(knee ≥ 12) ≥ 20% AND frac(knee ≤ 8) ≥ 40% — and the proxy proved
//! miscalibrated against its own purpose:
//!
//! - v1 (sequences axis): REJECTED under the frac bar (1.1% vs 20%); its
//!   margin is ~1.2× (K* = 12 vs the d_min = 10 floor-pinned probe median
//!   recorded by T2) — genuinely non-differentiating. Both forms agree.
//! - v2 (embedding scale [1, 4, 16]): REJECTED under the frac bar (11.1% vs
//!   20%) — yet its knees (median 5, max 16) would give margin ≈ 16/10 =
//!   1.6×: also < 2, so both forms AGREE here too, and the run exposes the
//!   REAL structural finding the frac bar could not name: **the a-priori
//!   `d_min = 10` floor caps the demonstrable margin at K*/10** — a corpus
//!   whose hard tail knees below 2·d_min = 20 cannot open the G2 gate under
//!   the transferred config, no matter how the probe behaves.
//!
//! **The correction (recorded, not silent):** from corpus v3 on, the sanity
//! gate is the margin form — margin ≥ 2× AND undefined ≤ 10% — which IS the
//! pre-stated purpose; the frac statistics remain in every printout as
//! context. The correction was committed BEFORE any margin-armed run; the
//! probe config is untouched; and the correction is falsifiable from this
//! record: it changes no v1/v2 verdict (both margins < 2), it names the
//! floor-cap mechanism, and v3 is designed against that mechanism.
//!
//! # Corpus v1 — the context/sequence axis (pre-registered `4332b056`)
//!
//! 27 singles + 4 seeded random sequences (seeds 4242..4245, token =
//! `Rng::next() % 27`) × 16 positions = 91 inputs.
//!
//! **MEASURED 2026-09-07:** REJECTED (frac bar) — knees median 3, q1 2,
//! q3 5, min 2, max 12, undefined 0/91; frac(knee ≥ 12) = 1.1%. G1 held on
//! all 91 inputs; the InterLoopNorm control held at τ ≤ 3 across all 91. The
//! context axis does NOT produce heterogeneous depth on the micro fixture.
//! Kept as a determinism witness (a rerun must print the same knees).
//!
//! # Corpus v2 — the embedding-scale axis, scale set [1, 4, 16]
//! (pre-registered `284942d0`)
//!
//! The v1 doc's pre-declared next candidate. One model; token `t`'s embedding
//! row is scaled by `V2_SCALES[t % 3]` (9 tokens per tier) — three input
//! magnitudes in ONE weight fixture. Declared caveat: an input-magnitude
//! axis, not a semantic one (per-input residual scale spans orders of
//! magnitude in real models — outlier dims / attention sinks).
//!
//! **MEASURED 2026-09-07:** REJECTED (frac bar) — knees median 5, q1 4,
//! q3 8, min 3, max 16, undefined 0/27; frac(knee ≥ 12) = 11.1%. The scale
//! axis moves knees (median 3 → 5, max 12 → 16) but not past the proxy bar.
//! G1 + control held on all 27.
//!
//! # Corpus v3 — the escalated scale axis [1, 8, 64] (pre-registered HERE,
//! before its run)
//!
//! Designed against the floor-cap mechanism above: the demonstrable margin
//! needs K* ≥ 20, and v2's scale→knee leak was sublinear (16× scale → tail
//! knee 16). v3 escalates one octave per non-base tier — `V3_SCALES =
//! [1.0, 8.0, 64.0]` — to push the hard tail toward/past K* = 20–32, with
//! the SAME single-fixture, three-tier, 27-single structure and the SAME
//! a-priori probe. Pre-declared branches:
//!
//! 1. **Non-finite branch:** if any full-depth reference is non-finite (the
//!    deep tier overflows), the corpus is REJECTED before the invariants —
//!    bit-identity asserts are meaningless on NaN (NaN ≠ NaN would false-red
//!    E1), and the issue records that the axis is stability-bounded at this
//!    scale.
//! 2. **Undefined branch:** undefined knees > 10% → REJECTED (the deep tier
//!    never converges within the budget; quality is not evaluable).
//! 3. **Margin branch:** margin < 2× → REJECTED with the floor-cap note —
//!    the recorded next lever is a `d_min` reduction, which requires its own
//!    pre-registration (it trades away the T2 knee-parity guarantee), or a
//!    larger fixture family (micro may simply be too easy to demonstrate
//!    EqR-style adaptivity).
//! 4. **Gate opens:** margin ≥ 2× AND undefined ≤ 10% → the G2 verdict is
//!    evaluated and recorded.
//!
//! **MEASURED 2026-09-07 (this run):** REJECTED (margin 1.20× < 2×) — and
//! the axis is REFUTED as a difficulty axis outright: the s64 tier measured
//! the EASIEST knees (3–6) while the max knee (12) sat in the s8 tier. The
//! micro loop's convergence depth is SCALE-INVARIANT — inter-iteration
//! normalization eats the embedding scale — and the knee variation that
//! exists (3..16) is token-identity lottery, not magnitude response. The
//! floor-cap mechanism was measured on all three corpora: median_all pins at
//! the d_min = 10 floor (everything fires 10–15) while K* ∈ {12, 16} →
//! margins {v1: 1.20×, v2: 1.60×, v3: 1.20×}, all < 2.
//!
//! # Micro-fixture conclusion (the campaign's final record)
//!
//! Three pre-registered corpora, three rejections, one mechanism: quality
//! parity needs `d_min ≥ ~10` (T2: dist at k = 6 = 0.051; knee medians 3–5)
//! while the margin needs `d_min ≤ K*/2 ≈ 6–8` — unsatisfiable on this
//! fixture family. G2 requires a FIXTURE-FAMILY change (a real checkpoint or
//! a larger synthetic config with genuinely heterogeneous convergence
//! profiles); further micro corpora are pre-committed to rejection by the
//! floor-cap. Post-hoc, NON-qualified observation (recorded as input to a
//! future pre-registration, not a pass): on all three corpora the probe's
//! (median = 10, max exit dist ≈ 1.6e-3) point sat strictly off the static
//! family's Pareto frontier (static-10: max dist 2.5e-2..3.9e-1; static-12:
//! median 12, max 1.6e-3..3.5e-3) — per-input adaptivity is visible in the
//! data but was never pre-registered as a gate. Invariants held on all 145
//! inputs across the three corpora: G1 bit-identity, exit ≡ elastic, the
//! InterLoopNorm control at τ ≤ 3.
//!
//! # Corpus v4 — the loop-weight-scale fixture family (the named lever,
//! pre-registered HERE, before its run)
//!
//! This is the FIXTURE-FAMILY change the conclusion above demands — not
//! another micro corpus (the config stays micro-SHAPED; "varied" sufficed,
//! "larger" was not needed). Why the axis exists at all: for a single token
//! with no prefix, attention over one key is trivially linear, so the loop
//! map h ← h + F(ĥ) is SHARED by all 27 tokens and only z0 = wte[t] +
//! wpe[0] differs — that is why knee variation was token-identity lottery.
//! The lever moves the MAP itself: scale the loop weights (the six attn/mlp
//! projections) by α. Larger α pushes the iteration's Jacobian toward the
//! oscillatory boundary; tokens whose z0 excites the slow modes become
//! genuinely hard (knee 20) while the rest stay easy — heterogeneous depth
//! in ONE fixture, the thing G2 needs. Embeddings and lm_head are untouched
//! (cosine quality is scale-free; the inter-iteration normalization eats
//! input-side scale, which is exactly why v3's axis was flat).
//!
//! **Selection disclosure (record, not concealment):** the family was found
//! by an EXPLORATORY scan — 144 fixture evaluations over {seed} × {α ∈
//! 1.0..10} — whose outcome variable WAS the G2 margin. That is an
//! existence-proof campaign by design: the conclusion names "a larger/varied
//! synthetic config whose per-input knees span ≥ 2× the quality-safe floor"
//! as the lever, and shopping for the family is how that lever is realized.
//! Scan structure (all rows deterministic):
//!
//! - Wave 1 (seeds 42/7/1234 × α 1..10): seed 42 gets FASTER with α (max
//!   knee 12 → 6); seed 7 is uniformly deep and the probe NEVER fires (the
//!   settle signal stays above threshold — churn, not convergence); seed
//!   1234 α 2 margin 1.09×. No candidate.
//! - Wave 2 (14 seeds × α {1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3}): the family is bimodal —
//!   contractive fixtures floor-pin at margin ≈ K*/10 ≤ 1.6×; churny
//!   fixtures never fire (margin 1.0×). Aggressive mixtures reach margin > 2
//!   but poison quality via floor-fires on hard inputs: seed 31337 α 1
//!   margin 3.2× / mean dist 0.180; 271828 α 1: 2.8× / 0.026; 21 α 1: 2.4× /
//!   0.019; 2 α 2.5: 2.13× / 0.014; 555 α 1: 2.18× / 0.010034 — fails by
//!   3.4e-5. Exactly one family passes everything.
//! - Wave 3 (α 2.6..4.0 on the five live seeds): the window is
//!   α ∈ [3.0, ~3.15] on seed 5; α 3.2 drops the tail knee back to 16
//!   (margin 1.6×).
//!
//! **Structural finding the scan surfaces: the weight-scale axis's margin
//! ceiling is EXACTLY 2.0×.** Every margin ≥ 2 fixture sits at exactly
//! K* = 2·d_min; a deeper tail (K* ≥ 24) always co-occurs with < 50%
//! floor-fires (the median lifts off the floor) or a poisoned mean. The G2
//! bar is therefore MET, never EXCEEDED, on this axis — the evidence-grade
//! caveat this record carries.
//!

//!
//! ## The v4 pre-registration
//!
//! - Fixture: seed **5**, loop-weight scale **α = 3.0** (the rounder window
//!   point; α 3.1 is the sensitivity neighbor — same margin, max exit dist
//!   0.0119 vs 0.0160).
//! - Corpus: the 27 micro tokens as singles (no input-side scaling).
//! - Probe: the a-priori transfer `τ = 1.0, d_min = 10` — NOT re-tuned.
//! - Gates: unchanged (margin ≥ 2× AND undefined ≤ 10%; G2 = cut ≥ 2× at
//!   mean dist ≤ 0.01).
//! - Control pre-checked as fixture design, BEFORE this commit: the
//!   InterLoopNorm control fires 0 across 8 τ values ≤ 3 on the α-scaled
//!   fixture (both window points).
//! - **Falsifiable prediction** (deterministic pipeline, so the run must
//!   reproduce the scan bit-exactly; any divergence indicts the scan or the
//!   wiring): knees median 8 / max 20, undefined 0/27; K* = 20; the probe
//!   fires 27/27 — 19 at the d_min = 10 floor + 8 late fires in 11..17 (the
//!   hard tail firing at ≈ its knee); median_all = 10; margin = 2.00×; mean
//!   dist at exit ≈ 8.7e-4, max ≈ 1.6e-2; **G2 PASS** (cut = 3.2×).
//!
//! **MEASURED 2026-09-07 (this run): the prediction reproduced bit-exactly —
//! G2 PASS.** Knees median 8 / q1 6 / q3 10 / min 4 / max 20, undefined
//! 0/27 (S14 = 20 the hard tail; S20 = 16; S5/S9 = 12); frac(knee ≥ 12) =
//! 14.8%. K* = 20. The probe fired 27/27: 19 at the d_min = 10 floor + 8
//! late fires [11 ×4, 13 ×2, 15, 17] — the hard tail firing at ≈ its knee
//! (S14: fire 17 vs knee 20, exit dist 0.0160 = the corpus max). median_all
//! = 10 → cut 3.20×, margin 2.00× (the bar met EXACTLY — the axis ceiling),
//! mean dist at exit 8.66e-4 ≤ 0.01, max 0.0160. Invariants: G1
//! fed-but-never-firing ≡ None 27/27; exit ≡ elastic bit-identity per fired
//! input; the InterLoopNorm control 0/27 at every τ ≤ 3. v1–v3 re-ran
//! identical (determinism witnesses). p99 fired depth 17 [support 1].
//!
//! **Verdict + evidence grade:** G2's pre-registered bar is MET — a ≥2×
//! median iteration cut at quality parity with per-input adaptivity visible
//! in the exit-depth distribution (floor-pinned easy majority, knee-tracking
//! hard tail). It is an EXISTENCE proof on a scan-selected synthetic
//! fixture, at the axis's measured margin ceiling (exactly 2.0×) — not
//! robustness evidence. T4 stays blocked: `cadence_gate` remains opt-in and
//! the probe slot is caller-owned (`None` = bit-identical), so default-on
//! would not change runtime behavior; promotion waits on real-workload
//! depth-spread evidence a synthetic micro campaign cannot produce. G1 held
//! in-harness; G4 is the T1 fixed-ring contract (`[f32; 4]`, no
//! steady-state allocation); p99 worst-case depth reported above.

// T6 — the HELD-OUT replication of the v4 loop-weight-scale mechanism
// (pre-registered HERE, in the commit BEFORE its run)
//-──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// # Why this exists
//
// v4's G2 PASS is self-disclosed as **existence-proof grade**: the fixture
// (seed 5, α 3.0) was picked by a 144-evaluation scan whose outcome variable
// WAS the G2 margin, and the margin landed at EXACTLY the bar (2.00×). That
// is precisely the evidence-grade caveat T4 defers on. Two claims the v4
// record makes are testable OUT OF SAMPLE at zero extra design freedom —
// same builder (`build_alpha_scaled`), same α, same untuned probe
// (τ = 1.0, d_min = 10), same gates, only the weight seed changes:
//
// 1. **the ceiling claim** — "the weight-scale axis's margin ceiling is
//    EXACTLY 2.0×; every margin ≥ 2 fixture sits at K* = 2·d_min".
// 2. **the rarity claim** — the caveat's force comes from the pass being
//    rare (1 family in 144 scan rows).
//
// A replication can only strengthen or weaken those; it cannot re-tune
// anything, because nothing here is tunable.
//
// # The held-out seed set
//
// **A recorded reproducibility gap:** the scan's full seed list was never
// committed (it ran out-of-tree; the module doc names 9 of the ~17 seeds it
// touched — 42, 7, 1234, 5, 2, 21, 555, 31337, 271828). "Held out" is
// therefore a claim relative to the RECORD, not a proof. It is made
// structurally as strong as the record permits: the set is defined
// MECHANICALLY as the contiguous run `1001..=1012` — disjoint from every
// seed the scan record names, from this file's `SEED`/`SEQ_SEEDS`, and from
// the memorable-constant style the scan sampled in. `t6_holdout_seeds_are_
// disjoint_from_the_recorded_scan_seeds` asserts the disjointness so the
// claim cannot silently rot.
//
// # Pre-registered predictions
//
// - **P1 (ceiling, the primary):** NO held-out fixture attains
//   `margin > 2.0×` while `mean_exit_dist ≤ 0.01`. A refutation is GOOD news
//   for the probe — it would mean the 2.0× ceiling is an artifact of the
//   scan's coverage and G2 has headroom the v4 record denies it.
// - **P2 (rarity):** `≤ 2 of 12` held-out seeds produce a full G2 PASS
//   (margin ≥ 2.0× AND cut ≥ 2× AND mean dist ≤ 0.01). Pre-declared reading
//   of the outcome, committed before the data:
//     * `0/12` → v4 confirmed as a lottery draw. The synthetic axis is
//       CLOSED (as T3's conclusion already suspected) and T4's "needs
//       real-workload evidence" defer is CORROBORATED, not merely asserted.
//     * `1..=2 / 12` → consistent with the scan's own base rate; the
//       existence-proof grade stands, unchanged.
//     * `≥ 3 / 12` → the "scan-selected, one-in-144" caveat is OVERSTATED:
//       the mechanism generalizes across the seed lottery at fixed α, and
//       G2's grade upgrades from existence-proof to **replicated
//       out-of-sample** on the synthetic axis.
// - **P3 (the invariants — the part that must hold unconditionally):** on
//   EVERY held-out fixture that passes the Phase-A0 finite-reference gate,
//   G1 (fed-but-never-firing ≡ `None`), exit ≡ elastic bit-identity, and the
//   InterLoopNorm control (0 fires at all 8 τ ≤ 3) hold. These are hard
//   asserts inside `run_g2_harness`, so the test FAILS on violation — they
//   are the probe's correctness contract and are seed-independent by
//   construction. This is the half of T6 that is a gate rather than a
//   measurement, and the half whose value does not depend on the G2 outcome.
// - **Admissible non-outcome:** α = 3.0 on an unlucky seed may diverge at
//   full depth (non-finite reference). Phase A0 rejects those; they are
//   reported as DIVERGED and excluded from P1/P2's denominator, which is
//   reported explicitly. A diverged fixture is neither a pass nor a fail.
//
// # MEASURED 2026-09-07 — P1 REFUTED · P2 1/12 · P3 VIOLATED then FIXED
//
// All 12 held-out fixtures were live (0 diverged at α 3.0), 324 inputs.
//
// - **P1 — REFUTED, and that is the good outcome.** Held-out seed **1002**
//   measured margin **2.40×** (K* 24 / median_all 10) at mean exit dist
//   5.44e-3 ≤ 0.01 — strictly ABOVE the 2.0× the v4 record called the axis's
//   exact ceiling. The ceiling was an artifact of the scan's coverage, not a
//   property of the weight-scale axis, so G2 has headroom the v4 record
//   denied it. (Post-fix the same fixture measures margin 2.18× / cut 2.91×
//   at a 2.4× BETTER mean dist — still above the ceiling, still a G2 PASS.)
// - **P2 — 1/12 G2 PASS (seed 1002).** Pre-declared reading, taken as
//   written: consistent with the scan's base rate ⇒ **the existence-proof
//   grade STANDS, unchanged.** Non-qualified note (input to a future
//   pre-registration, NOT a pass): 1/12 at FIXED α = 3.0 is not comparable to
//   the scan's 1/144, which ranged over {seed} × {α} — the two denominators
//   count different things, so no rate claim is made here.
// - **P3 — VIOLATED on seed 1003: the InterLoopNorm negative control fired
//   40 times over 8 τ × 27 inputs, first at (τ = 0.001, S2, k = 14).** τ
//   cannot explain a fire at the SMALLEST τ in the set, and it did not: with
//   τ = 0.0 (magnitude arm mathematically disabled) the fire is identical, so
//   it is the SHAPE arm. Localized further — the fire is invariant from
//   `settle_floor` 0.5 down to 1e-5 and vanishes only at
//   `decay_ratio_max ≤ 0.3`, i.e. it is `classify`'s **rule-3 decay
//   fall-through** on a newer/older half-window ratio in [0.3, 0.5): a
//   transient 2-vs-2 DIP inside a plateau whose newer half stays above 0.5.
//   5/27 inputs false-positived via the shape arm alone.
//
//   **What P3 falsified:** (i) the T1 record's "guarded by construction"
//   claim — the arms are OR'd and rule 3 has no absolute floor, so arm 2 can
//   fire alone on a churning loop; (ii) T2's amendment of the control
//   boundary from τ ≤ 10 to τ ≤ 3, which treated a shape-arm false positive
//   as if τ bounded it — the τ ≤ 3 boundary was fixture luck; (iii) the
//   sufficiency of T5's calibration rule, which governs rules 1-2 only.
//
//   **Fix-forward (same session):** `LoopResidualExit::with_shape_persistence`
//   — the shape arm requires `DEFAULT_SHAPE_PERSISTENCE = 2` CONSECUTIVE
//   `Settled` windows (a `None` or `Churning` resets the run). Orthogonal to
//   calibration, one `u32` counter, zero-alloc. `with_shape_persistence(1)`
//   recovers the pre-T6 behavior exactly and is retained as the control arm
//   (no loser to demote). Pinned both directions by
//   `t6_seed_1003_control_violation_is_pinned_both_directions` (the defect
//   must still reproduce at persistence 1) and four katgpt-core unit tests.
//
// **The fix is a strict improvement on every corpus measured** — same
// verdicts, better quality, control clean:
//
// | corpus | verdict | margin | cut | mean dist | max dist | E3 control |
// |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
// | v1 / v2 / v3 | REJECTED (unchanged) | 1.20× / 1.60× / 1.20× | — | — | — | clean |
// | v4 (seed 5) | **G2 PASS** (unchanged) | 2.00× | 3.20× | 8.66e-4 → **1.02e-4** | 1.60e-2 → **1.31e-3** | clean |
// | T6 seed 1002 | **G2 PASS** | 2.40× → 2.18× | 3.20× → 2.91× | 5.44e-3 → **2.23e-3** | 2.15e-2 → **1.26e-2** | clean |
// | T6 seed 1003 | REJECTED | 1.00× | — | — | — | **40 fires → 0** |
// | T6 1004/1005/1010/1011 | REJECTED | <2× | — | 9.2e-2/8.1e-2/8.9e-2/2.4e-2 → **0/0/4.2e-3/1.3e-2** | — | clean |
//
// v4's cut and margin are IDENTICAL post-fix while its worst-case exit
// distance improves 12×; the premature dip-triggered exits that were
// poisoning quality on four held-out fixtures are gone. So the fix removes a
// false-convergence class without costing any measured adaptivity.
//
// **What this does and does not do for T4.** It repairs a probe defect and
// refutes a structural claim, and P3's zero-fire control now covers 4 + 12
// fixtures / 496 inputs instead of 4 / 172. It does NOT change T4's status:
// P2 came out inside the pre-declared band, so the synthetic G2 evidence is
