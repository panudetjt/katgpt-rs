"""GATE: a CROSS-REPO `Issue N` / `Plan N` / `Bench N` citation that names no repo.

`numbering_gate.py` protects a number from being allocated TWICE in one repo.
It structurally cannot see the failure one level up: a citation whose referent
lives in a DIFFERENT repo. `Issue 750` in this repo's prose meant
`riir-ai/.issues/750_behavior_first_quantization_promotion_gate.md`, and this
repo's own `.issues/.highwater` read **748** — two away. The moment anybody
follows the Numbering Discipline and allocates 749, then 750, that citation
stops dangling and starts resolving, silently, to the WRONG document. A
dangling reference is an inconvenience; a reference that rebinds to a real but
unrelated issue is a wrong answer delivered with a straight face.

Measured when this gate landed (2026-09-12): EIGHT unqualified rows over THREE
numbers — `Issue 513` (riir-train, x3), `Issue 750` (riir-ai, x3), `Issues
490/493` (riir-ai, x2). Every one resolved uniquely by TITLE match, and the
convention for writing them was already in the same file four lines away
("riir-ai `.issues/892`", "894 resolved same day in riir-ai").

⛔ **The AMBIGUOUS bucket is this gate's stated blind spot, not a clean pass.**
A number that exists BOTH locally and in a sibling is undecidable from the
number alone, and there were **35** such cited Issue numbers at landing. This
gate is green over them by construction: its predicate is "does NOT resolve
locally", so a bare `Issue 47` naming riir-ai's 47 reads as this repo's 47 and
always will. It is REPORTED every run and deliberately NOT gated: a
ceiling on it reds whenever somebody writes a perfectly correct citation to a
NEW local number that a sibling also happens to have — a nuisance red for a
right action, and a gate that reds on right actions is a gate that gets
bypassed (`staged_set_audit.py`'s rationale, one axis over). So it has the
standing of tail support in the percentile audit: a quantity that ORDERS the
rows and sizes the blind spot, never a verdict. The only real defence is the
writing convention — name the repo whenever the referent is not local,
ambiguous or not.

Exit 0 clean, 1 on an unqualified citation, **2 if the instrument is
untrustworthy** (a floor breached => the walk went blind; a scanned document
missing). An unreliable instrument is not the same finding as drift.

⛔ **The CI lane cannot adjudicate and does not pretend to.** docs_gate.yml
runs per-push on main in a SINGLE checkout — no sibling workspace, so the
ownership lookup is structurally empty and every cross-repo citation would
read as a false finding. A blind run therefore refuses (exit 2) UNLESS the
workflow has marked the context with DOCS_GATE_CI=1, in which case the gate
verifies only the axes decidable from this checkout (documents present, the
width bound, the citation walk over its floor) and says in its LAST line —
docs_gate.sh prints only tail -1 of a passing check — that the cross-repo
axis is DEFERRED to the workstation run. The marker is an explicit opt-in
recorded in the workflow file, never auto-detected, so a blind WORKSTATION
run (a moved repo, a missing sibling) still refuses. Found the hard way:
the gate landed during a main-only CI window and the first promote push was
its first CI run (HISTORY.md 2026-09-12).

# as free. Measured over every tracked `.md` in 19 repos (Issue 753,
# 2026-09-12) it is not free:
#
#   51 false HEADS  — `## Bench 1: Throughput`, `| Bench 3 | …`: a section
#                     NUMBERING inside a document, never a citation of
#                     `.benchmarks/001_*`. 0 of them are real.
#    0 false TAILS  — because the list expander already carries a PLURAL
#                     precondition. That is the load-bearing half, and it is
#                     what keeps `Plan 460, 31.5%` -> Plan 31 and
#                     `Issue 096, 2,294 LOC` -> Issue 2 from ever being built:
#                     both heads are SINGULAR. Re-measured with `\d{2,4}` in
#                     force, 0 tail expansions anywhere in the corpus land on
#                     the integer part of a measurement.
#
# ⛔ The 0 is a correction of this session's own first number, which was 55 —
# measured with the plural precondition DROPPED, and so over-stating the cost
# of a widening in the direction that flattered the conclusion. The two rules
# are not independent and neither may be costed alone. The head count moved
# 44 -> 51 between two runs an hour apart for the ordinary reason (the corpus
# is edited by five-plus concurrent sessions): read it as a magnitude.
#
# So the bound buys ~51 suppressed false rows for 0 suppressed true ones.
# What the class DOES need is liveness: "0 occurrences" is a dated measurement
# over documents edited daily, and the day somebody writes `Issue 6` the
# verdict regex goes silently blind on it. These two patterns are the bound's
# own complement — counted every run, pinned at 0, and a breach is exit 2
# (instrument untrustworthy), not exit 1 (prose drift): the prose did not get
# worse, the scope grew a form the verdict cannot see.
