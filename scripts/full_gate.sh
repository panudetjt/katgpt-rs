# Full gate — the whole-surface compile + lint claim, as an assertion.
#
# Every build command in AGENTS.md's "Build Commands" block is narrow on at
# least one of three INDEPENDENT axes, and a green result says nothing about
# what the invocation compiled to nothing:
#
#   1. `check` vs `clippy`      — two `cargo refine` escape classes are rejected
#                                 by clippy's typeck and accepted by `check`
#                                 (E0689 ambiguous-integer, E0631 deref
#                                 coercion in `redundant_closure`).
#   2. default vs --all-features — non-default gated code compiles to NOTHING.
#   3. `-p <crate>` vs --workspace — at the SAME default features: a crate's own
#                                 non-default feature can be switched on by the
#                                 ROOT crate's defaults once the root is in the
#                                 selected set. `cargo test -p katgpt-backend
#                                 --lib` compiled clean while the workspace run
#                                 failed, because `gpu.rs` sits behind
#                                 `katgpt-backend/gpu_inference` and the chain
#                                 katgpt-rs/default -> async_qdq_overlap ->
#                                 inference_router -> gpu_inference only fires
#                                 when the root crate is selected.
#
# Missing `--all-targets` is a fourth: it skips every test / bench / example,
# which is where gated code lives.
#
# Consequence, measured: this gate was RED on `develop` from at least 2cb97410
# until 3e58e821 — five broken targets — while every documented gate was green.
# Two of the five were `cargo refine` escapes that survived the healer's own
# compile gate, because that gate ran where the code was absent.
#
# Layers, all hard-fail:
#   1. cargo present
#   2. platform coverage   → `target_os = "macos"` code (katgpt-backend's
#                            gpu.rs / ane.rs) is invisible off macOS EVEN WITH
#                            --all-features, because the cfg is an `all(...)`
#                            over target_os AND feature. A Linux run of this
#                            gate reproduces the exact vacuous green it exists
#                            to catch, so off-macOS is a partial gate and says
#                            so loudly.
#   2b. wasm32 coverage   → a SECOND platform axis. `wasm32-unknown-unknown`
#                            is compiled by nothing else in this repo, and its
#                            hot kernels need `+simd128` on top (the target
#                            defaults to OFF), so both arms run. Derived
#                            package list; the sites no `-p … --lib` reaches
#                            are pinned by membership.
#   2c. x86_64 lint       → the INVERSE of what x86_64_execution_matrix.sh
#                            closed: that instrument EXECUTES the x86_64 arms
#                            and does not lint them, and every lane that lints
#                            compiles them to nothing (2/3/6 are aarch64, 2b is
#                            wasm32, test_gate does not lint). `avx2` is a
#                            SECOND gate on top of `target_arch`, so both arms
#                            run; measured 30-and-0 (Issue 819). Derived
#                            package list, four named non-src targets, the
#                            residue outside both pinned by membership. The
#                            TRIPLE is disclosed on the verdict line.
#   3. the gate itself     → clippy, workspace, all targets, all features
#   4. zero errors         → any `error` line or unbuildable target is a finding
#   6. profile axis        → the same tree with debug_assertions OFF; the four
#                            axes below all run in the DEV profile (.docs/10_audits/debug_release_profile_axis.md)
#   6b. profile×default     → Layer 6 runs --all-features, which SUPPLIES
#                            `alloc_tracking` — the (release × default-features)
#                            cell was asserted by nothing until Issue 758 fell
#                            through it (slice_tca/tests.rs E0432). Same three-
#                            package population as test_gate.sh.
#   5. doc/script parity   → AGENTS.md must quote the same command this script
#                            runs; a gate whose spec has drifted from its
#                            implementation is a gate nobody is running
#

# printed `✓ full gate PASSED — 0 errors …` — byte-identical to a real macOS
# run — with the partial-ness announced only by a Layer-2 `⚠` roughly six
# hundred lines of build output earlier. That is this repo's own most-repeated
# rule broken by the one instrument that is not a sweep: a deferral rides the

# ── Log retention + the completion sentinel (Issue 734; moved above Layer 1 by
#    Issue 737 T4 so the --wasm32-only mode is sentinel-protected too) ────────
# Every `exit 1` below is an explicit verdict and passes through untouched.
# What this arm catches is the OTHER death: bash aborting mid-script while
# reporting success. Measured on macOS `/bin/bash` 3.2.57, and ONLY there
# (Issue 735): bash 4.4 through 5.3, dash and busybox ash all PRESERVE the
# status. On 3.2, when `set -u` hits an unbound expansion or `eval` hits a
# syntax error, the shell enters the EXIT trap with `$?` **already 0**, so an
# EXIT trap whose last command succeeds makes the abort exit **0**. Only "did
# the script reach its own last line?" catches it — and that catches every
# other premature death too (a `set -e` trip in an unguarded spot, a SIGTERM,
# a future editing slip), on EVERY shell, which is why this stays even where
# 3.2 is out of the picture. It is load-bearing on the macOS CI lane
# (full_gate.yml measured it in situ, Issue 735 T3) and inert-but-cheap on
# ubuntu's bash 5, where an abort reds the job on its own.
#
# Retention (Issue 701 R3b): a PASS still reports a warning count whose
# per-lint breakdown exists only in the log, and a warm re-run emits almost
# nothing (cargo does not replay diagnostics for crates it considers fresh) —
# so a caller who NAMED a path via FULL_GATE_LOG asked for the file on pass as
# well as on fail; an unnamed run's temp log is cleaned up on success.

# Layer 2 is about ONE platform axis (`target_os = "macos"`). `wasm32` is a
# second, and until 2026-09-07 nothing in this repo compiled it: the only
# script that ever built for `wasm32-unknown-unknown` was
# `scripts/build-moka-wasm.sh`, which a human runs before a deploy.
#
# It is doubly invisible, which is why it rotted. The hot kernels are gated on
# `all(target_arch = "wasm32", target_feature = "simd128")`, and
# `wasm32-unknown-unknown` defaults to NO simd128 — so a plain
# `--target wasm32-unknown-unknown` run compiles the SCALAR fallback and the
# SIMD half to nothing. Both arms are needed; neither implies the other.
#
# Measured on the run that produced this layer: 14 findings in
# `katgpt-moka-wasm` alone, of which ELEVEN were `unsafe_op_in_unsafe_fn`
# (edition-2024 `warning[E0133]`, on its way to a hard error) — in a crate
# whose whole reason to exist is to be shipped to a browser.
# Positive-surface derivation — the wasm32_surface_audit.py vocabulary: a
# file counts as surface only when it carries a COMPILE-TIME, non-negated
# wasm32 cfg. Two classes are deliberately NOT surface:
#   `#![cfg(not(target_arch = "wasm32"))]` — a native-only guard; the file
#       compiles to NOTHING on wasm32 and cannot break it. Counting it made
#       every new native-only test/bench demand a residue pin (the class
#       Issue 738 T3 fixed for the python audit; this is the fourth
#       instrument to meet it).
#   `cfg!(target_arch = "wasm32")` — a RUNTIME branch; both arms compile on
#       every target, so the native --all-targets lane already compiles the
#       wasm32 arm. Nothing wasm32-specific is left uncovered.
# Line-based, with one measured limit: a multi-line `not( ... )` wrapper
# re-includes its inner lines — over-inclusion, the safe direction (the
# file lands in the residue pin below and demands a human read instead of
# silently vanishing from the accounting).

# ── Layer 2c: x86_64 + avx2 LINT coverage (Issue 819) ───────────────────────
# Layer 2b closed a platform axis by COMPILING a triple nothing else compiled.
# This closes the same shape one arch over, and the hole it fills is the
# INVERSE of the one `scripts/x86_64_execution_matrix.sh` closed on
# 2026-09-16: that instrument EXECUTES the x86_64 arms and does not lint them,
# and every lane that lints — Layers 2/3/6 here (macOS/aarch64), Layer 2b and
# `wasm32_gate.yml` (a third triple), `test_gate.sh` (does not lint, and runs
# at default target-features) — compiles the x86_64 arms to NOTHING.
#
# Measured on the workstation that found it (Issue 819 T1): 30 findings, every
# one `unsafe_op_in_unsafe_fn` on edition 2024, every one in
# `dash_attn/channel_aware.rs`, against 0 on the avx2-off arm. That file
# carries two transcriptions of one kernel and only the aarch64 one had the
# `unsafe { }` block — repaired on the arm a lane compiles, not on its twin.
# It is Issue 737's 0-and-14 wasm32 measurement reproduced one platform over,
# and it is the argument for running BOTH arms here: `target_feature = "avx2"`
# is a SECOND gate on top of `target_arch`, so a lane that selects an x86_64
# triple and forgets the RUSTFLAGS compiles the hot half to nothing and
# reports a green ZERO wearing a triple.
#
# ⚠ Unlike 2b this lane is `--all-features`. Two reasons, neither taste:
# (1) it makes the layer exactly Layer 3's feature coverage re-run on the
# x86_64 arch, which is the claim being RESTORED rather than a new one;
# (2) the four non-`src/` targets below each carry a `required-features` row,
# and a hand-typed feature list beside them is this repo's own most-repeated
# drift shape. `--all-features` is not a supported TEST configuration here
# (fixture RNG streams and GOAT calibrations are per-feature) — this layer
# does not RUN anything.
#
# ⚠ `--all-features` is not optional HERE in a way it is not elsewhere:
# `katgpt-attn` has `default = []`, so at default features `dash_attn` — and
# with it both files the 30 findings live in — compiles to NOTHING. A
# default-features version of this lane is the green ZERO it exists to catch.
# The cost it buys is a native one: `--all-features` turns on
# `katgpt-tokenizer`'s optional `good_lp`, hence `highs-sys`, hence cmake and
# a C++ toolchain. NOT capped here, deliberately — Layer 3 has the identical
# exposure and capping one and not the other is this repo's most-repeated
# drift shape — but the failure is loud and self-identifying, and the remedy
# is one line: a 24-way `cmake --parallel` on a loaded box dies with
# `cl : command line error D8040` (measured 2026-09-17, with a g200 training
# run and three agent sessions resident); `CMAKE_BUILD_PARALLEL_LEVEL=4`
# builds the same package clean. That is the BOX, not this lane.

# 2026-09-03, adding --release produced 2 errors and `cargo test --release -p
# katgpt-core --lib` did not compile AT ALL (.docs/10_audits/debug_release_profile_axis.md).
#
# `check`, deliberately, not `clippy`: this axis is about COMPILATION with
# debug_assertions off. The lint surface is already covered by Layer 3, and
# clippy's lints do not vary by profile except on the small `cfg(not(
# debug_assertions))` surface — a residual noted rather than paid for.
#
# NOT folded into GATE_ARGS: Layer 5 asserts AGENTS.md quotes that string
# verbatim, and this is a different question with a different command.
#
# Liveness, not just an error count (.issues/705): a run that compiles nothing
# reports zero errors, which reads exactly like a pass.
# --message-format=json, and that is the load-bearing choice here. The first
# cut counted "Compiling"/"Checking" lines like Layer 3 does, and reported
# INCONCLUSIVE on its very first in-situ run: the release tree was already warm,
# so cargo compiled 0 units and printed nothing. Freshness must not decide a
# liveness verdict. `compiler-artifact` records ARE emitted for fresh units â
# measured on the same warm tree, 3 "Checking" lines vs 1,423 artifacts.
#
# It also makes this layer immune to the ANSI-colour trap that zeroed every
# ^-anchored counter in this gate's first two CI runs (.issues/705): JSON keys
# carry no colour codes.

# ── Layer 6b: profile axis × DEFAULT features (Issue 758, 2026-09-12) ────────
# Layer 6 runs --all-features, which SUPPLIES `alloc_tracking` — so one cell
# of the profile×feature matrix was asserted by NOTHING:
#
#   (dev, default)       test_gate.sh   EXECUTED, floored
#   (dev, all)           Layer 3        clippy compile + lint
#   (release, all)       Layer 6        check compile
#   (release, default)   Layer 6b (this) check compile
#
# The hole was real and recent: slice_tca/tests.rs imported `crate::alloc`
# unconditionally at MODULE level (Phase 31, 2026-09-12) — E0432 under
# `cargo test --release -p katgpt-core --lib` at default features — and Layer 6
# was GREEN the whole time because --all-features turned the feature on
# (Issue 758). Every other alloc-importing test survived this cell only by
# carrying its own `#[cfg(any(debug_assertions, feature = "alloc_tracking"))]`.
#
# Scope — the test_gate.sh population (katgpt-rs, katgpt-core, katgpt-dec at
# its pca_global row), NOT --workspace: a workspace run inherits the PLATFORM
# axis (katgpt-backend's metal examples are unresolvable off macOS at ANY
# feature set — measured 2026-09-12: E0433 ×10+ in
# examples/bench_mtp_metal_batch_floor.rs on Windows), which Layer 2 owns and
# refuses on. These three packages are the platform-invariant core
# (test_gate.sh's platform-invariance analysis). If you add a row to
# test_gate.sh's ROWS, add its package here too — same population, different
# axis. `--tests`, not --all-targets: the class lives in cfg(test) code;
# targets skipped by unmet required-features at default features are exactly
# what `cargo test` at defaults would skip — the lane asserts the cell over
# what default features SELECT.
#
# Canary (two-sided, 2026-09-12): the Issue-758 import reintroduced → the
# katgpt-core row fails `could not compile (lib test)`; restored → clean.
# Cost on this lane's first run (16-core workstation): root 40 s cold-ish,
# core + dec ≈ 2 s (warm from Layer 6's neighbours); expect minutes on a
# 4-core CI runner — the default-features units are disjoint from Layer 6's
# all-features units (feature fingerprint), so 6b pays its own compile.
