//! Issue 691 — Stale-Residual Speculative Layer Pipelining POC
//! (arXiv:2608.23841 §6.3 Approach A + B — the paper's own UNTESTED
//! hypotheses; first measured verdict).
//!
//! Real Kimi-K3-0.40B weights (`data/kimi-k3-0.40b/model.safetensors`),
//! real tiktoken prompts, pure CPU. Cross-repo traces (Bonsai-27B /
//! Gemma-2-2B, dumped by riir-ai's `stale_residual_trace_dump` example)
//! extend T1 to the other model classes when present under
//! `$STALE_RESIDUAL_TRACES` (default `data/stale_residual_traces/`).
//!
//! Sections:
//! - G1 anchors (determinism, capture bit-identity)
//! - T1: per-layer residual-dominance ratios + the paper's viability bar
//!   (>50% of layers, median ratio < 0.05), K3 + external SRTR traces
//! - T2: accept-rate θ-sweep × delay-layer grid, conditional top-1
//!   preservation + KL among accepted; persistent-hazard arm (stale-written
//!   KV/KDA state survives accepts — the compounding-corruption measurement)
//! - T3: Approach-B closed-form δ-predictors (router-logit, x_in-linear),
//!   held-out R² + corrected-replay quality lift
//! - Latency: `(C+IO)/max(C,IO)` overlap model at OUR stream ratios, three
//!   regimes (RAM-resident shared-bus / disk-resident hideable / GPU H2D),
//!   accept-rate adjusted
//!
//! Run:
//! ```bash
//! cargo bench --features "kimi_k3_loader stale_residual" \
//!     --bench bench_683_stale_residual_poc -- --nocapture

    "The lighthouse keeper counted seventeen steps down to the tide pool every morning, and every morning the count came out different. He attributed this to the erosion of the cliff path, though the true cause was that he never started counting from the same step. The village below had long stopped listening to his tide reports, which was a shame, because on the morning of the storm they were entirely accurate.",
    "A hash map resolves collisions by chaining or open addressing. Chaining keeps a bucket list per slot; open addressing probes forward until an empty slot appears. Linear probing is cache friendly but suffers primary clustering. Quadratic probing reduces clustering. Robin Hood hashing equalizes probe distances by stealing from rich buckets. The load factor threshold determines when to grow the table.",
    "fn main() { let mut total: f64 = 0.0; for i in 0..1000 { total += (i as f64).sqrt() * 0.001; } println!(\"sum is {}\", total); } The program accumulates a thousandth of each square root into a running total and prints it with six decimal places of precision.",
    "\"You keep saying the machine dreams,\" the inspector said. \"I keep saying it produces output,\" the engineer answered. \"The distinction matters legally, not philosophically. If it dreams, shutting it down is cruelty. If it produces output, shutting it down is maintenance.\" The inspector wrote neither word in his notebook. Outside, the machine produced output.",
    "Photosynthesis converts light energy into chemical energy stored in glucose. The light-dependent reactions occur in the thylakoid membrane, splitting water to release oxygen. The Calvin cycle fixes carbon dioxide in the stroma. RuBisCO catalyzes the primary fixation step and is remarkably inefficient, processing only a few reactions per second, which plants compensate for with sheer abundance.",
    "The trade route crossed three deserts and one mountain range that appeared on no official map. Caravans measured distance in water, not miles: a two-skin crossing, a five-skin crossing. Maps made by surveyors were ignored in favor of the older hydrography, which is why the border treaty failed and why the town of Kesmet exists in two countries at once, depending on which well you drink from.",
    "In the beginning the committee archived everything. Then storage costs rose and they archived only summaries. Then summarization was automated and the summaries of summaries drifted until the archive described a university that had never existed, complete with a founder nobody remembered inventing. The founding date was the drift artifact: 1847, chosen by an interpolation error in 2031.",
    "Consider a queue where arrivals follow a Poisson process and service times are exponential. The M/M/1 queue has a simple closed form: mean wait is rho over mu times one minus rho, where rho is the utilization. Little's law holds regardless of distribution: the average number in the system equals the arrival rate times the average time in system, which is why the line looks longer than it feels.",
    "The instrument was tuned to the resonance of the room rather than to itself. Musicians who visited complained it sounded wrong until they stayed a week, after which every other room sounded wrong. The builder called this the second ear: the one you grow for a space. Recording engineers removed the resonance with filters and the recordings sounded dead, which proved nothing either way.",
    "Memory consolidation during sleep replays the day's hippocampal sequences to the neocortex at accelerated speed. The replay is not literal: segments are skipped, reordered, and occasionally stitched into counterfactual routes. The stitching is believed to serve credit assignment, though this remains contested and the counterfactual routes sometimes appear in later behavior.",
    "The migration tool supported three strategies: lift and shift, replatform, and rewrite. Each failed differently. Lift and shift reproduced the outages. Replatform reproduced them with new names. The rewrite was cancelled twice and finished once, by which time the business had changed shape and the requirements described a product nobody sold anymore, to customers who had retired.",
    "Salt marshes sit between the tide and the land, accumulating sediment until they sit above the tide, at which point they become meadow unless the sea rises to reclaim them. The accretion loop is tight: more grass traps more sediment, raising the marsh, which grows more grass. Engineers who channelized the creeks broke the loop and the marsh subsided within a decade.",
    "def quicksort(xs): if len(xs) <= 1: return xs; pivot = xs[len(xs) // 2]; lo = [x for x in xs if x < pivot]; eq = [x for x in xs if x == pivot]; hi = [x for x in xs if x > pivot]; return quicksort(lo) + eq + quicksort(hi). The implementation is not stable and not in place but it is short and it is correct.",
    "The negotiator's rule was never to accept the first version of anything: the first price, the first apology, the first draft of the ceasefire line. Counterintuitively, this also applied to her own proposals. When she caught herself satisfied, she assumed the satisfaction was information about fatigue, not about quality, and revised once more before sending anything to the other side.",
    "A monad is a monoid in the category of endofunctors. Practically: it is an interface with two operations that must satisfy three laws. The laws guarantee that sequencing is associative and that the identity operation does nothing, which is precisely what lets you ignore the plumbing when reasoning about the effects that the plumbing exists to sequence.",
    "Fog on the harbor swallowed the ferry schedule whole. The schedule had never been more than a suggestion, but fog made the suggestion honest. Commuters who relied on the printed times waited on principle; those who watched the water simply left when the boat appeared. Two epistemologies, one dock, and the boat came when the boat came regardless.",
