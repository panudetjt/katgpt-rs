//! Bit-plane packed ternary weights with group-wise f16 scale (Issue 578).
//!
//! The `Q2_0_g128` container. Ternary `{-1, 0, +1}` like [`crate::TernaryWeights`],
//! but the scale is per **128-weight group** (as in [`crate::BinaryWeights`])
//! instead of per row.
//!
//! ## Why a third tier
//!
//! | Tier | Alphabet | Scale | Holds `Q2_0_g128`? |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | `TernaryWeights` | `{-1, 0, +1}` | per row, f32 | no — wrong scale granularity |
//! | `BinaryWeights` | `{-1, +1}` | per 128, f16 | no — no zero state |
//! | **`TernaryGroupWeights`** | `{-1, 0, +1}` | per 128, f16 | **yes** |
//!
//! `BinaryWeights::from_ternary_no_zeros` cannot bridge the gap: it returns
//! `None` the moment any weight is zero, and ternary sparsity is the whole
//! point of the format.
//!
//! ## Footprint
//!
//! Two bit-planes = 2 bits/weight, plus 16 bits per 128 weights = **2.125
//! bits/weight**. At 27B params that is 7.17 GB — matching Ternary-Bonsai-27B's
//! ~7.2 GB deployed size, so loading a `Q2_0_g128` tensor into this container is
//! a *repack*, not an expansion.
//!
//! ## Group/block alignment
//!
//! [`GROUP_SIZE`] is 128 and blocks are 64 bits, so **every group spans exactly
//! two whole `u64` blocks**. Kernels rely on this: a group boundary is never in
//! the middle of a block, so the scale can be switched between blocks without
//! splitting a word.

/// - both clear → weight = 0 (implicit, no storage)
///
/// **Representation invariant:** `pos_bits[i] & neg_bits[i] == 0` for every `i`.
/// A weight cannot be both `+1` and `-1`. See [`Self::invariant_holds`].
