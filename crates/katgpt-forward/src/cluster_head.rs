//! Bound-based stage-1 selection for the clustered LM head (Issue 657).
//!
//! # The bound
//!
//! [`clustered_lm_head`](crate::forward::clustered_lm_head) ranks clusters by
//! `⟨h, centroid_c⟩`, which — because the centroid is the mean of the cluster's
//! LM-head rows — is exactly the cluster's **mean logit**, while the question
//! stage 1 must answer is which cluster contains the **max**. Write
//! `w_t = centroid_c + r_t` and let `radius_c = max‖r_t‖`
//! ([`cluster_radii_from_map`](crate::cluster_build::cluster_radii_from_map)).
//! Cauchy–Schwarz gives, for every `t` in cluster `c`:
//!
//! ```text
//! logit[t] = ⟨h, centroid_c⟩ + ⟨h, r_t⟩ ≤ ⟨h, centroid_c⟩ + ‖h‖ · radius_c
//! ```
//!
//! Cost is one `f32` per cluster and one FMA per cluster in stage 1.
//!
//! # Read this before using `TopK` with radii
//!
//! Issue 657 proposed the bound as a better *ranking* function. **Benchmark 658
//! measured that it is not.** `radius_c` varies little across clusters while
//! `‖h‖` is shared, so the added term is near-constant and mostly swamps the
//! signal: on the structured fixture, bound-ranked `TopK` scores *below* the
//! plain mean ranking at every budget (0.41 vs 0.675 at 25% active). Plan 574's
//! recall failure turned out to be a degenerate k-means seeding, fixed in
//! [`cluster_build`](crate::cluster_build) — not a scoring defect.
//!
//! [`ClusterStop::TopK`] with `radii: Some(..)` therefore exists to keep that
//! comparison runnable, not because it is the configuration to ship.
//!
//! # What the bound is actually for
//!
//! [`ClusterStop::Admissible`] — the thing the mean score cannot do at all.
//! Visit clusters in descending bound order and stop as soon as the next bound
//! falls at or below the best **exact** logit already found. Every unvisited
//! cluster provably holds nothing larger, so the argmax **cannot** be missed:
//! recall is 1.0 by construction rather than by measurement, and the budget
//! becomes a reported outcome instead of a silent correctness risk.
//!
//! Its cost is data-dependent, and the spread is the whole story: **7.30%** of
//! the vocabulary touched on a clustered head, **99.99%** on a geometrically
//! flat one.
//!
//! # Do not enable this unconditionally
//!
//! Issue 661 measured the crossover: the clustered path beats the full head
//! only below roughly **21–34% active**, and the loss above it is severe
//! (0.11–0.35×). Enable below ~15% active; use the full head above ~25%.
//!
//! The wall-clock win is also well below the FLOP reduction — 2.21× measured
//! against 11.64× of arithmetic saved — and the shortfall is **locality**, not
//! threading. Cluster members are non-contiguous token IDs, so stage 2 gathers
//! scattered rows at 20.6 GB/s where the full head streams at 108.0 GB/s; the
//! 5.26× ratio accounts for the gap exactly. Wave-parallelism was tried and is
//! a wash (Issue 661 §661a). Issue 666 permutes the rows into cluster order,
//! which is the fix that addresses the actual cost.
//!
//! See `.benchmarks/658_clustered_lm_head_admissible_goat.md`.
//!
//! Both stop rules are deterministic functions of shipped weights —
//! **modelless**, no training. The hot path allocates nothing; all scratch is
//! caller-owned.
