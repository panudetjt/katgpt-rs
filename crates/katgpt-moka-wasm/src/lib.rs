//! Minimal standalone WASM build of the Moka v1 port (Plan 565).
//!
//! Exists purely to answer one measurement question: is our native Rust
//! port of Moka's own network, compiled to WASM and run in a real browser,
//! faster than the real deployed Moka (which the same plan measured directly
//! at ~6.4 ms/move median in real Chrome — see `.docs/06_game_arenas/
//! go_arena.md`)? No `katgpt-core` dependency (so no ahash/getrandom wasm32
//! backend friction a browser deployment has no reason to carry), no game
//! engine beyond what's needed to generate realistic self-play positions.
//!
//! API shape deliberately mirrors the real Moka JS package
//! (`createGameState`/`encodeStudentFeatures`/`getLegalMoves`/`playMove`/
//! `selectHighestLegalMove`, from `github.com/millionco/moka`'s
//! `src/game.ts`) so the browser benchmark harness can drive both sides
//! with the same self-play loop shape.

// ── Issue 204 follow-up: full-game arena via wasmi (win-rate parity test) ──
//
// The latency test above answers "how fast is PUCT+WASM?". The honest gap
// left open (documented in `go_arena.md` Table C "Strength parity note") is
// "does the WASM port actually WIN at the native rate (94–98%)?". This
// section closes that gap by running complete PUCT-vs-greedy-Moka games
// entirely through the wasm binary — the strongest possible parity evidence,
// because the exact shipped wasm code is exercised end-to-end (board rules,
// feature encoding, forward pass, PUCT search, greedy argmax, scoring).
//
// wasmi is a deterministic IEEE-754 interpreter (same binary → same moves as
// Chrome's JIT — wasm spec mandates bit-identical execution modulo host
// bugs), so the win rate measured here IS the in-browser win rate. Slower
// (~46×, see Table C), but the moves chosen are identical, and win rate is an
// emergent property of move choices, not speed.
//
// Design: a single global `ArenaState` owns the board + move history + PUCT
// player + greedy (Moka weights/scratch). The host is a thin driver: reset →
// opening random moves → alternate PUCT/greedy searches (each advancing the
// board) → score. No board logic is duplicated on the host side.

// These exports test whether the WASM extmul-based int8 dot kernel delivers
// a similar speedup under V8 JIT.
//
// Rust's stable `core::arch::wasm32` does NOT expose `i32x4_dot_i8x16_s`
// (the direct i8×i8→i32x4 dot product instruction). We use the extmul path:
//   1. i16x8_extmul_low_i8x16(a, b)  → 8 i16 products from low halves
//   2. i16x8_extmul_high_i8x16(a, b) → 8 i16 products from high halves
//   3. i32x4_extadd_pairwise_i16x8   → pairwise sum to i32x4
// This is 7 instructions for 16 multiplies vs f32's ~16 instructions.
