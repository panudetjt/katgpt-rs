//! Bench 847 — Issue 847: are `simd_lut_dequant`'s and `bf16_convert`'s AVX2
//! arms REACHED on an ordinary x86_64 build?
//!
//! ```text
//! # (1) the default build — the configuration everybody ships
//! cargo test -p katgpt-core --release --features simd_lut_dequant,bf16_simd \
//!     --test bench_847_avx2_arm_reachability -- --nocapture
//!
//! # (2) the same thing with the arm's compile-time predicate satisfied
//! RUSTFLAGS="-C target-feature=+avx2" cargo test -p katgpt-core --release \
//!     --features simd_lut_dequant,bf16_simd \
//!     --test bench_847_avx2_arm_reachability -- --nocapture
//! ```
//!
//! # The instrument, and why its DEFAULT reading is the proof
//!
//! Each dispatcher (`dequant_via_lut`, `dequant_dot_via_lut`,
//! `bf16_bits_to_f32_into`) selects an AVX2 kernel behind
//! `#[cfg(all(target_arch = "x86_64", target_feature = "avx2"))]` and otherwise
//! falls through to a scalar one. `target_feature = "avx2"` is a **compile-time**
//! predicate and is OFF by default on x86_64, so on an ordinary build the AVX2
//! arm compiles to nothing and the dispatcher calls the scalar path.
//!
//! This target compares each **dispatcher** against its own **public scalar**
//! function, and prints BOTH absolute figures. The reading rule is not the
//! ratio:
//!
//! ⛔ **Compare a row's ABSOLUTE ns across the two builds; the within-build
//! ratio is confounded and the first run of this target was read wrongly
//! because of it.** Under `+avx2` the *scalar* arm is compiled with AVX2
//! available too, so LLVM may autovectorise it — measured: `bf16` scalar goes
//! 200 ns → 97 ns at n=4096 while the intrinsic arm goes 201 → 169. Both arms
//! move between builds, so the ratio column mixes two effects. The
//! **dispatcher's own** absolute time, default vs `+avx2`, is what isolates
//! "what the compile-time gate costs".
//!
//! ⚠ And a within-build ratio near 1.00 is evidence only when the two arms are
//! otherwise the same code. `dequant_via_lut` reads 1.5–1.7× on a build where
//! its AVX2 arm cannot exist — a generic `#[inline]` dispatcher gets its
//! `shift`/`mask` constants propagated into the inlined scalar body while a
//! direct out-of-line call to the same scalar function does not. That row is
//! confounded in BOTH builds and only its cross-build delta means anything.
//! `dequant_dot_via_lut` and `bf16_bits_to_f32_into` read 1.00–1.01, which is
//! the clean form of the evidence.
//!
//! # It is a GATE now, and it bars exactly ONE row
//!
//! The defect is repaired (both dispatchers take a runtime `simd_level()` probe),
//! so the measurement above is history and what a run can still assert is the
//! property the repair established: **on x86_64 the dispatcher must be
//! meaningfully faster than its own scalar reference.** A compile-time gate
//! re-introduced anywhere in that dispatch collapses it back to ~1.00 and reds.
//!
//! ⛔ **Only `dequant_dot_via_lut` is barred, and the reason is the confound
//! above.** That row measured **1.00–1.01** while its AVX2 arm did not compile
//! and **5.0×** after the repair, so a bar between those is a real wall.
//! `dequant_via_lut` read **1.5–1.7× even while broken** (const-propagation into
//! an inlined scalar body), so the same bar would have passed the defect — a
//! guard that greens on the thing it guards against is worse than none.
//! `bf16_bits_to_f32_into` is **deliberately unbarred**: its arm is still
//! compile-gated and its intrinsics lose to LLVM's autovectorised scalar under
//! `+avx2` (169 vs 97 ns), which is Issue 847 T2 and not a reachability
//! question.
//!
//! The bar is 1.5× against a measured 5.0×: over 3× of slack, because this is a
//! REACHABILITY assertion and not a perf budget.
//!

///   1698, 1704 ns at n=32768;
/// - every AVX2-bearing arm is **BIMODAL**, ~98 or ~170 ns at n=4096, with
///   the two clusters separated by 1.75x and nothing in between;
/// - the mode is picked per PROCESS and per ARM — one run had the dispatcher
///   fast (97) and `_autovec` slow (175) in the same measurement.
///
/// A loaded box produces a SPREAD. Two clusters with a gap, while the scalar
/// arm beside them does not move, is a property of the run rather than of
/// the machine — so T6's premise is refuted and its instruction ("run it
/// somewhere quiet") could never have settled the question.
///
/// This arm tests the leading hypothesis DIRECTLY instead of running the
/// same benchmark again: `vec![…]` guarantees only the element's alignment,
/// so a 256-bit `loadu`/`storeu` sequence starts at whatever the allocator
/// returned, and a ~50/50 split is what a 32-byte-alignment coin flip looks
/// like. It measures the SAME kernel over sub-slices whose start address is
/// forced to a known residue mod 32, and prints the residue next to the
/// time.
///
/// ⛔ A REPORT, and deliberately not a bar. The asserted part is the one no
/// box state can touch: every alignment must produce BIT-IDENTICAL output,
/// because an alignment cannot change a conversion. If the timings turn out
/// flat across residues the hypothesis is refuted and the bimodality needs a
/// different explanation — which is a result, and the reason this prints a
/// table rather than a verdict.
