//! Integration test: end-to-end ALS parity between the Kronecker B-step
//! path ([`low_rank_fit`]) and the Jacobi B-step path
//! ([`low_rank_fit_jacobi_bstep`]) on a config where both are feasible.
//!
//! Issue 185 T2 contract: on a config where both paths are feasible
//! (e.g. `r=4, d_h=96, K=4, M=8, R=1`), assert that the two paths produce
//! ALS solutions agreeing to ~`1e-6` after the same iteration count.
//!
//! This is the end-to-end version of the unit-level parity check in
//! `karc::large_dh::tests::jacobi_b_step_matches_kronecker_small`. The
//! unit test verifies one B-step in isolation; this test verifies the full
//! ALS loop (init → A-step → B-step → scale-rebalance → convergence).
//!
//! Both paths solve the same Sylvester equation per B-step but use different
//! float-operation orderings (Kronecker Cholesky vs eigenbasis
//! diagonalization), so bit-identity is not expected — only agreement to
//! ~`1e-10` (well below the convergence `tol` of `1e-8` typically used).

// uses `linalg::symmetric_eig` (Householder tridiag + implicit-shift QL)
// instead of `karc::jacobi_eigen` for the one-time G eigendecomp. This test
// verifies the swap is transparent: the ALS solution still matches the
// Kronecker path to the same tolerance as the Jacobi-path test above.
//
// Same input shape, same tolerance, same assertions. The only difference
// from `als_jacobi_matches_kronecker_d96_r4` is that the underlying G-path
// eigensolver is Householder+QL rather than Jacobi. Both must agree with the
// Kronecker reference — proving the wiring is correct and the new eigensolver
