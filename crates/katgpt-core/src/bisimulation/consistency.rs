//! `consistency` — rule-application consistency metric (Issue 586).
//!
//! Source paper: BDH-CQ (arXiv:2608.09888 §6.4) reports an 18.5-point gap
//! between test-pair accuracy (77.9%) and strict-task accuracy (59.4%) on
//! ConceptARC: 52/160 tasks produce one or two correct outputs but are never
//! solved as a whole. Interpretation: a correctly induced rule should
//! transfer to every test input; partial success means the transformation is
//! **not applied consistently** — and isolated correct outputs are
//! indistinguishable from a narrower rule applied completely.
//!
//! This module ships the missing half of "demonstration-conditioned operator
//! binding": [`rule_consistency`] measures whether a bound/inferred operator
//! ([`super::OperatorSchema`], via [`super::infer_operators`]) is applied
//! consistently across repeated/parallel applications, WITHOUT any training.
//! Binding without this gate can promote a flaky operator to committed state
//! (engram / chain commitment) with no signal that it only works on half the
//! inputs.
//!
//! # What it measures
//!
//! Given N applications of one operator, grouped into tasks (an application
//! is one invocation; a task is one "solve this input" episode with ≥1
//! applications — the paper's ARC task ↔ test-pairs split):
//!
//! - **3-bin histogram** over tasks: strict (all correct) / partial (some) /
//!   none — the paper's strict-task accuracy decomposition.
//! - **Gap** = application accuracy − strict-task accuracy, with a
//!   small-sample sigmoid guard (`gap_confidence`) so 2-task samples don't
//!   produce overconfident "inconsistent" verdicts. Sigmoid, NOT softmax
//!   (global rule: a binomial-confidence analog is a per-quantity bound).
//! - **Structure-preservation breakdown** over failures: localized error
//!   (output shape correct — the paper's extrapolation-failure signature)
//!   vs construction failure (wrong shape — execution-failure signature).
//! - **Complexity-clustered regime**: failures forming a contiguous suffix
//!   of complexity levels beyond a clean prefix. This is the coverage-failure
//!   signature that triggers exemplar-seeking in the downstream curiosity
//!   policy (riir-ai Issue 672).
//!
//! # Regime semantics (the T3 PoC's three separable regimes)
//!
//! | Regime | Failure signature | Right response |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | [`ConsistencyRegime::Consistent`] | none (or ≤ `NOISE_TOL` scattered) | gate on accuracy alone |
//! | [`ConsistencyRegime::NoisyFlaky`] | uniform across levels (i.i.d.) | do NOT commit; re-estimate reliability (CLR `should_write_memory` territory) |
//! | [`ConsistencyRegime::ComplexityClustered`] | clean prefix, broken suffix | seek ONE exemplar at the boundary level (Issue 672) |
//! | [`ConsistencyRegime::Ambiguous`] | graded / mixed | gather more evidence |
//!
//! # Modelless + zero-alloc
//!
//! Pure functions over a borrowed slice; the report is a fixed-size `Copy`
//! struct (two `[u16; 33]` per-level histograms). No allocation, no weights,
//! no training. Cold-path by design: called per skill-evaluation session,
//! not per tick.
//!
//! # Input contract
//!
//! Applications MUST be sorted by `task` (non-decreasing) so each task's
//! outcomes are contiguous — enforced by a `debug_assert`. The caller
//! collects outcomes per task anyway, so the contract is free to satisfy.
//!
//! # Lookup-binding caveat (Research 479 design caution)
//!
//! The paper's parameter binding is demonstrated-value lookup, NOT
//! interpolation — unseen values score 0% even when in-range. A
//! `ComplexityClustered` verdict therefore means "cover the boundary level",
//! and one exemplar at level c repairs exactly level c in the modelless
//! analog (the trained model partially transfers to neighbors; the
//! modelless policy re-targets after re-measuring instead — see Issue 672).
