//! Hint-Regret VoI primitive — paired-rollout value-of-information estimation.
//!
//! **Plan 576** · Research 496 (SPADE, arXiv:2608.19197) · Research 500
//! (EnvHarness wrapper composition) · game-side guide: riir-ai
//! `.research/340` (frontier curriculum).
//!
//! The distilled modelless question this module answers: *how much would one
//! hint (a demonstration, a revealed best arm, a demo path) improve the
//! agent's return on this content?* That quantity — the hint regret `r̂` — is
//! the discriminator a curriculum needs to separate content that is
//! **learnable-hard** (hint unlocks it → offer it) from content that is
//! **mastered** (hint adds nothing, agent already succeeds) or
//! **intractable** (hint adds nothing, agent fails anyway → retire it).
//! Static difficulty heuristics cannot make this distinction; the paired arm
//! can, at ~µs scale, with zero model weights on the hot path.
//!
//! # Composition
//!
//! - [`HintRegretEstimator`] (this file) — Phase 1: the paired estimator.
//! - [`gate`] — Phase 2: sigmoid band-pass difficulty gate + three-regime
//!   triage + Wilson CI on the learnable-share statistic.
//! - [`memory`] — Phase 3: regret-scored content memory (salience decay,
//!   oldest-first + absorbing-intractable eviction) and Beta-LCB frontier
//!   ordering over [`crate::best_belief`] (DRY consume, not re-implementation).
//!
//! # The paired contract (common random numbers)
//!
//! Each pair is one content instance rolled out twice under the **same
//! random seed** (CRN — common random numbers): arm A with the hint, arm B
//! without. The estimator is pure arithmetic over the recorded pairs — the
//! CALLER owns the rollouts and the seed pairing. CRN is load-bearing: the
//! shared noise source cancels in the paired difference, so the empirical
//! variance of `r̂` collapses relative to independent-seed estimation
//! (pinned by the G2 gate: variance ratio ≥ 2×).
//!
//! Sign convention (Guide 340 §"distilled modelless primitive", resolved
//! against the landed consumer — riir-mmorpg-examples `frontier_regime_of`):
//! `r̂ = mean(hinted) − mean(unhinted)` = **the regret the unhinted agent
//! pays for missing the hint** = the value of the hint. High `r̂` → the hint
//! unlocks a lot → frontier content. (The guide's prose lists the arms
//! "with-hint / without-hint" and writes `mean(B) − mean(A)`, which under
//! that listing yields the hint's *negative*; the triage direction
//! `r̂ ≥ τ_r → Frontier` only makes sense with the consumer's gain sign, so
//! the consumer wins — the primitive must supersede the inline collapse
//! *semantically*, not just generically.)
//!
//! # Confidence machinery (honesty notes)
//!
//! - The **Hoeffding** half-width uses only the known per-arm return range
//!   `[lo, hi]` (difference range `2·(hi−lo)`). It is distribution-free and
//!   CRN-invariant — the guarantee cannot see the variance reduction. It is
//!   the named schedule: `K(ε,δ) = ⌈(b−a)²/(2ε²)·ln(2/δ)⌉` pairs suffice.
//! - The **empirical-Bernstein** half-width ([`RegretEstimate::eb_half_width`])
//!   adapts to the sample variance and therefore DOES capture the CRN win,
//!   at the cost of an additive `O((b−a)/n)` term (Maurer & Pontil 2009).
//!   Callers whose pairs are CRN-shared may stop on it once `n` is large
//!   enough that the additive term is small.
//! - The **CLT** half-width (`1.96·s/√n`) is exposed for diagnostics only —
//!   no finite-sample guarantee.
//!
//! Zero-allocation steady state: the estimator is three Welford
//! accumulators (O(1) memory, no heap); all outputs are by-value structs.
