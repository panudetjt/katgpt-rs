//! Issue 668 — `effective_degree`: a modelless **function-space** simplicity
//! metric (Research 488 / arXiv:2605.29823, Zhang, Li, Xiao, Chen & Chen,
//! *Quantifying and Optimizing Simplicity via Polynomial Representations*,
//! ICML 2026).
//!
//! # What it measures
//!
//! Restrict an arbitrary frozen function `f: ℝᵈ → ℝᵐ` to a 1-D **interpolation
//! path** between two real data points,
//!
//! ```text
//! x(α) = α·a + (1−α)·b ,   α ∈ [0, 1]
//! ```
//!
//! sample `f` at `r` nodes along that path, fit a degree-`K` Chebyshev
//! expansion `P(α) = Σₖ cₖ·Tₖ(2α−1)` by damped least squares, and report the
//! coefficient-weighted degree
//!
//! ```text
//! ED(P)      = Σₖ ‖cₖ‖·k
//! ED_norm(P) = Σₖ ‖cₖ‖·k / Σₖ ‖cₖ‖
//! ```
//!
//! ED is **Lipschitz in the coefficients** (unlike algebraic degree, which is a
//! discontinuous 0/1 read on the leading term), so it is robust to fitting
//! noise. Paper Theorem 3.1 (order preservation) is what licenses the 1-D
//! surrogate: for multivariate polynomials, degree drops under path restriction
//! occur only on a measure-zero set of directions, so averaging over random
//! data-anchored paths preserves degree ordering almost surely.
//!
//! Everything here is **modelless** — no training, no gradients. The metric
//! probes a function that is already frozen (a shard decode, a KARC readout, a
//! LoRA overlay, an NPC policy). The paper's differentiable ED *regularizer*
//! (its §7) is training-only and is explicitly out of scope — see Research 488
//! §7 for the riir-train record.
//!
//! # Four caveats that decide whether a number here means anything
//!
//! 1. **Data-manifold dependence (paper C.1).** The path endpoints MUST be real
//!    data pairs. With random-noise endpoints the ED signal collapses to
//!    baseline — the paper measures this directly. Feed real wake events, real
//!    observed states, real prompts; never `rand()` vectors.
//! 2. **Scale dependence (paper Table 12).** Raw [`EdResult::ed`] scales
//!    linearly with output magnitude (×2 outputs ⇒ ×2 ED). Compare functions
//!    only at a common output scale, or use [`EdResult::ed_norm`], which is
//!    invariant under `y ↦ s·y`. The paper's own regularizer fits post-softmax
//!    probabilities for exactly this reason.
//!
//! 3. **DC offset drags `ed_norm` down.** `ED_norm` is a magnitude-weighted
//!    mean of the degree index over **all** coefficients including `k = 0`, so
//!    a function with a large constant term reads lower than its algebraic
//!    degree — measured in Bench 665: a degree-5 restriction with a natural DC
//!    term reads `ed_norm = 1.15`, while the same coefficients with `c₀` zeroed
//!    read `1.63`. Ordering across functions is unaffected (that is the paper's
//!    claim and it holds), but do not read `ed_norm` as "the algebraic degree".
//!    For an offset-free read, zero [`EdResult::coeff_norms`]`[0]` and re-reduce
//!    through [`ed_from_coeff_norms`]; that quantity is bounded in `[1, p]` for
//!    a degree-`p` restriction.
//!
//! 4. **The sign is grain-dependent — verify it at YOUR grain.** Measured on
//!    real substrate (riir-neuron-db Bench 484, 360 shard states): ED correlates
//!    with the generalization gap at **+0.598 pooled across regimes** but
//!    **negative within every individual regime** (−0.18, −0.68, −0.35, −0.25) —
//!    a Simpson reversal reproduced on 3 disjoint seed sets. A one-sided
//!    threshold `ed_norm < τ` therefore does the right thing *between* regimes
//!    and the exactly wrong thing *inside* one, and no choice of `τ` fixes it.
//!    The paper's own correlation study measures only the across-model grain, so
//!    this inversion is unmeasured upstream. **State which grain you operate at
//!    and measure the sign there before wiring ED into any gate.**
//!
//! A fifth, softer caveat (paper §7 MNIST-CIFAR failure): ED enforces/measures
//! *simplicity*, not *correctness*. A wrong-but-simple decode passes an ED
//! gate. Any consumer gate must keep a correctness arm alongside ED.
//!
//! # Substrate reuse
//!
//! - Chebyshev evaluation: [`crate::karc::ChebyshevBasis`] (the sealed
//!   `KarcBasis` dictionary shipped for KARC forecasting — same basis, orthogonal
//!   purpose, so this module consumes it rather than re-deriving the recurrence).
//! - Damped normal equations: [`crate::linalg::cholesky_f64`] +
//!   [`crate::linalg::chol_solve_f64`]. The Gram is accumulated in **f64** for
//!   the same reason KARC's `fit_direct` does — f32 Cholesky is fragile when the
//!   damping `ε` falls below f32 epsilon relative to the matrix scale.
//!
//! Only the ED reduction and the randomized-cosine node sampler are new.
//!
//! # Why Chebyshev only
//!
//! Paper §3.2 reports Legendre works equally well and Appendix I shows the
//! degree *ordering* is preserved across the basis swap. This module ships the
//! Chebyshev path because that basis already exists in-tree; the ordering
//! invariance is a *gate*, not a runtime knob, and is exercised in
//! `tests/bench_668_effective_degree_goat.rs` by fitting an explicit Legendre
//! design matrix and reducing it through the shipped [`ed_from_coeff_norms`].
//!
//! # Allocation
//!
//! [`effective_degree_along_path`] (scalar outputs) is fully stack-resident —
//! it takes no scratch and allocates nothing. The vector-output and
//! multi-path entry points take a caller-owned [`EdScratch`], allocated once
//! and reused; steady state is zero-alloc (G4).
//!
//! Feature: `effective_degree` (opt-in, implies `karc_forecaster`). **Consumer
//! verdict is in and the gate did not change:** riir-neuron-db Issue 602's
//! freeze-gate PoC closed SCOPE-LIMITED 2026-08-17 (Bench 484). ED out-predicts
//! the incumbent `can_freeze::output_flatness` 12.6× pooled (0.598 vs 0.047) but
//! is not wirable as a one-sided freeze gate because of caveat 4, and its power
//! there traces to the DC term (caveat 3), not to shape complexity. Stays
//! **opt-in as a diagnostic surface**; the live consumer axis is cross-regime
//! triage — the KARC regime-mismatch probe of Research 488 §4, which is the
//! grain where the sign is correct.
