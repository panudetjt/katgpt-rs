//! Calibrated sigmoid gate — Platt-style refit for decision/confidence scalars.
//!
//! Every decision/confidence scalar in the stack is a sigmoid output, and its
//! calibration is proven nowhere: Lean proves boundedness (range (0,1));
//! nothing proves the numbers *mean* anything ("fear = 0.8" is not known to
//! fire ~80% of the time). This module adds the missing, published, modelless
//! half: a per-direction two-parameter refit (temperature + bias) over
//! recorded `(sigmoid_output, binary_outcome)` pairs — Platt 1999; Guo et al.
//! 2017 (arXiv:1706.04599); Kadavath 2022 (arXiv:2207.05221).
//!
//! Modelless mandate: the ONLY mutated state is two latent scalars per
//! direction plus the evidence window — mutation class #3 (a direction
//! vector + sigmoid gate updated from labeled outcomes), never base weights.
//! The fit is a deterministic convex 2-parameter Newton solve (fixed
//! iteration count, smoothed targets à la Platt), not gradient descent on a
//! network; replaying the same pairs yields bit-identical parameters.
//!
//! Shape (Issue 810):
//! - `observe(p, outcome)` — record one pair into a fixed-capacity FIFO ring
//!   (zero alloc after construction).
//! - `refit()` — off-hot-path refit of `(w, c)` in `p_cal = sigmoid(w·z + c)`
//!   where `z = logit(p)`; equivalent to the issue's
//!   `sigmoid((logit(p) − b)/T)` with `T = 1/w`, `b = −c/w`.
//! - `apply(p)` — hot path: one logit, one fma, one sigmoid. Zero-alloc;
//!   the same cost class as any bare sigmoid gate.
//! - `commitment()` — BLAKE3 over versioned canonical bytes (params + total
//!   observation count), the small-artifact convention of
//!   `closure::commitment`; freeze/thaw consumers treat it like any
//!   snapshot.
//!
//! Monotonicity guard: `w > 0` is enforced (projection to `W_MIN`) —
//! calibration must never reorder decisions. Over the reals that also
//! preserves ranking and every threshold-optimal decision (G3); in f32 it
//! is carried by TWO further mechanisms (Issues 909–911): the
//! resolution-aware `w` floor (a shipped map must resolve the window's own
//! score gaps — distinct scores stay distinct in f32) and the
//! zero-tolerance AUC guard (`refit` refuses any fit whose map drops the
//! evidence window's own AUC; identity keeps the raw ordering). Out-of-
//! window saturation is the consumer's re-measure (reflex Bench 095: 15/15
//! suites preserved).
//!
//! Solver (Issue 910): the Lin–Lin–Weng 2007 form of Platt's solve —
//! base-rate start `(0, ln((n⁺+1)/(n⁻+1)))` + Armijo-backtracked Newton.
//! Platt's original undamped full step from the identity start is the
//! documented flaw: on a narrow-z window the first Hessian is near-singular
//! and the step lands the iterate in a saturated corner where the Hessian
//! collapses (the Issue-909 stall, measured 10.8×/23× above the achievable
//! loss on the real reflex windows; an f64 mirror stalls identically — not
//! a precision defect).
//!
//! UQ "Report the Floor" rule (Research 322 / Plan 340): a calibrated gate
//! must still beat the dumb baselines — the constant base-rate predictor and
//! the uncalibrated sigmoid itself — on Brier/log-loss (G2). Calibration is
//! not free: if the refit cannot beat those floors on the evidence window,
//! the honest answer is the identity transform, which the occupancy floor
//! makes the default until evidence says otherwise.
