//! Stale-residual speculative layer pipelining — the modelless primitives
//! (Issue 691 / Research 508, arXiv:2608.23841 §6.3 Approach A + B).
//!
//! For **standard** (non-delay-rewritten) transformer checkpoints, residual
//! dominance (`‖δℓ‖/‖x_in^ℓ‖ ≪ 1`) suggests layer ℓ+1 can begin on the
//! **stale** residual `x_in^ℓ` while layer ℓ is still computing —
//! accept-with-correction when the layer contribution lands small,
//! rollback-and-recompute when it doesn't. The paper proposes this and never
//! runs it; this module holds the pure analysis half so the first measured
//! verdict can be produced over real checkpoints (the K3-0.40B simulator
//! lives in the root crate's `kimi_k3` module; cross-repo trace producers in
//! riir-ai feed [`residual_dominance_from_trace`] for Bonsai/Gemma classes).
//!
//! Three primitives, all pure f32 math, zero deps, no allocs in the steady
//! state (callers own buffers):
//!
//! 1. **Residual-dominance table** ([`LayerRatioStats`],
//!    [`layer_ratio_stats_into`]) — per-layer `‖δℓ‖/‖x_in^ℓ‖` distribution
//!    over held activations + the paper's viability bar
//!    ([`PAPER_VIABILITY_BAR`]: >50% of layers with median ratio < 0.05).
//! 2. **Accept gate** ([`AcceptGate`]) — the threshold rule; accept iff
//!    `ratio < θ` (the rollback machinery is consumer-side).
//! 3. **Overlap latency model** ([`OverlapLatency`]) — the paper's
//!    `net = (C+IO)/max(C, IO_eff)` I/O-overlap predictor (their §1.2),
//!    parameterized by bits/weight so it projects at OUR ternary stream
//!    ratios (Research 508 §2.0) and not just the paper's Q4 numbers.
//!
//! Distinct from shipped cousins (do not conflate): `HydraSkipPlan` **drops**
//! layers on cumulative-DE thresholds; token-level speculative decode
//! (`LeviathanVerifier`, GDN tree-verify) speculates **tokens**, not layer
//! inputs. Nothing here executes anything — it scores what a simulator
//! measured.
