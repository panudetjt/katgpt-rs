//! Validation harness + diagnostics for the TPR binding algebra
//! (Issue 707 T6/T7) — the instruments the GOAT gate reads, kept out of the
//! runtime path.
//!
//! Three parts, matching Research 527 §6:
//!
//! - **(a) fit band** — [`validate_bindings`]: holdout residual band + unbind
//!   cosine + surgery additivity, all measured on states the fit never saw.
//! - **(c) systematicity** — [`withheld_pair_top1`] against
//!   [`AtomicNull`]: a per-pair lookup table CANNOT answer a withheld
//!   `(role, filler)` combination, so TPR beating it is the systematicity
//!   certificate. A null that also fails **in-distribution** is VACUOUS and
//!   certifies nothing — [`AtomicNull::coverage`] reports exactly that, and
//!   callers must check it before quoting an OOD win (the measured healer-corpus
//!   failure, riir-clippy `.benchmarks/062_withheld_pair_ood.md`).
//! - **diagnostics** — [`bow_router`] (does this state family carry binding
//!   structure at all?) and [`bic_select`] (which role scheme?).
