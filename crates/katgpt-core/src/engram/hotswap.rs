//! `EngramHotSwap` — atomic runtime table replacement.
//!
//! Plan 299 Phase 5 T5.1–T5.4, T5.7–T5.8. Mirrors the
//! `SenseHotSwap` pattern (moved to riir-engine::sense::hotswap in Issue 007 Phase C):
//! `AtomicPtr<Box<dyn EngramTable>>` + `AtomicBool` lock. The lock blocks
//! readers during swap (Option A per plan T5.4) — acceptable because table
//! updates are infrequent. Crossbeam-epoch reclamation is NOT used; the
//! writer briefly sets the lock, readers spin-wait, then the writer drops
//! the old table after the new pointer is published.
//!
//! # Memory reclamation
//!
//! The writer is responsible for dropping the old table. We use a simple
//! protocol:
//! 1. Writer: `lock.compare_exchange(false, true, AcqRel, Acquire)` — acquire
//!    exclusive swap permission.
//! 2. Writer: `ptr.swap(new_ptr, AcqRel)` — atomic pointer publication.
//! 3. Writer: `current_commitment.store(..., Release)` — update fast id.
//! 4. Writer: `lock.store(false, Release)` — release.
//! 5. Writer: `drop(Box::from_raw(old_ptr))` — free the old table.
//!
//! Readers spin on `lock.load(Acquire) == false` before loading the pointer.
//! Because the lock blocks readers BEFORE step 5, no reader can be holding
//! a borrowed reference to the old table when it's dropped. This is safe
//! under the assumption that `with_table` calls are short (microseconds) —
//! table updates are infrequent enough that this never stalls writers
//! meaningfully.
//!
//! # CRITICAL — never softmax
//!
//! Per AGENTS.md this module contains **no `softmax` symbol**. It's pure
//! atomic-pointer plumbing.
//!
//! # Latent vs raw boundary
//!
//! - The [`EngramTable`](super::EngramTable) trait object is **latent** —
//!   slot contents never cross the sync boundary.
//! - The `current_commitment: AtomicU64` is the **raw** low-8-bytes of the
//!   table's BLAKE3 root. It exists for fast identity checks across the
//!   sync boundary (clients can verify the table they observe matches a
//!   committed snapshot without learning the slot contents).
