// Architecture note — Batch Renormalization (BatchRenorm):
//
// The reference JAX implementation uses BatchRenorm (not standard BatchNorm
// or LayerNorm) for network stability with highly off-policy data. Key params:
//   - r_max = 3 (maximum correction ratio)
//   - d_max = 5 (maximum correction difference)
//   - warmup = 1000 steps (gradual correction ramp-up)
//
// BatchRenorm constrains the running-statistics correction to prevent
// divergence when training on highly off-policy replay data — critical
// for LEO's all-goals Q-learning where the same network processes
// experiences from many different goal-conditioned policies.
//
// Implementors SHOULD use BatchRenorm (or an equivalent constrained
// normalization) in their LeoHead network architectures. Standard
// BatchNorm is insufficient; LayerNorm is acceptable but may underperform.

/// Critic gradient oracle for test-time guidance.
///
/// Provides `∇_a Q(s, a)` — the gradient of the critic (value function)
/// with respect to the action — evaluated at a *projected* final output.
/// This is the modelless primitive that powers QGF (Q-Guided Flow),
/// distilling the test-time gradient-guidance principle from
/// arXiv:2606.11087 (Zhou et al., 2026).
///
/// # QGF Design Decision: Drop the Jacobian (J ≈ I)
///
/// Per the QGF paper §5, the gradient is computed at a **first-order
/// Euler approximation** of the clean output (`â_1 = a_t + (1-t)·v_θ`),
/// and the Jacobian `∂â_1/∂a_t` is intentionally **dropped** (set to
/// identity). This is *not* a lazy approximation:
///
/// - It gives **lower variance** than the full BPTT gradient (paper Fig 3)
/// - It is **cheaper** (no backprop through the generator)
/// - It produces **better** Q-optimization (paper Fig 4)
///
/// **Do NOT add chain-rule backprop through the generator** in downstream
/// implementations — it re-introduces the high-variance BPTT path that QGF
/// was designed to avoid. The existing FFT smoothing in `FlowFieldCache`
/// is the equivalent variance-reduction mechanism for our discrete case.
///
/// # Usage
///
/// Implement this for any value-function-like type:
/// - `LeoHead` (Q-values for all goals/actions)
/// - `FlowFieldCache` (Q-values → FFT smoothed → gradient field)
/// - `ActionBridge` (latent → raw action via ternary direction dot-product)
/// - A BFN-rejection-sampling proxy (Freeze-tier fallback, no trained critic)
