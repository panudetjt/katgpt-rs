//! Pool admission — hysteresis admission policy for a fixed-capacity resident
//! set (Issue 873 primitive A; Research 581 mechanism rows #6/#7/#8, distilled
//! from volotat/mini-AGI `paged.py:569-714` @ `96784b7`, MIT).
//!
//! # The policy
//!
//! A candidate displaces the weakest **evictable** resident only when its
//! want-score beats the victim's by the multiplicative [`DEFAULT_MARGIN`]
//! (×1.10); a newcomer is un-evictable for `dwell` ticks measured from its
//! **admission tick, never a last-use tick**; during cold start exactly one
//! never-admitted item receives a fair turn per cycle (terminating sweep,
//! re-arms only on universe growth); the accepted set is read out by
//! identity so the caller's load count is the true set delta.
//!
//! The three hysteresis legs and what each refuses:
//!
//! | Leg | Refuses |
//! |---|---|
//! | margin ×1.10 | churn on noise — a candidate within 10% of the weakest resident moves nothing (the set is stable under a flat distribution) |
//! | dwell-from-admission | eviction cascades over newborns — a freshly admitted resident gets `dwell` ticks to earn usage before it can be displaced |
//! | fair-turn sweep | starvation of never-demanded items — without it, a zero-observed-want item can never enter, so the system can never discover it is wanted |
//!
//! # The clock law (measured the hard way at mini-AGI `paged.py:242-247`)
//!
//! Residents are touched every cycle (want-scores refresh). A dwell clock
//! reading a **last-use** tick would therefore read every resident as
//! permanently young and the set could never move. [`ResidentRow`] carries
//! **no last-use field at all** — the invariant holds by construction (the
//! `calibration_staleness` posture), and
//! [`since_admission_not_last_use_is_the_dwell_clock`] pins the behavior:
//! a resident touched every single cycle becomes evictable at exactly
//! `admission_tick + dwell`.
//!
//! # Leaf-clean (the `suspect_indices` house pattern)
//!
//! Want-scores are CALLER-SUPPLIED — this module never produces a signal,
//! it only governs over one. The natural producer in this crate is
//! [`crate::kv_eviction::score`] (usage-rate `cum_mass/max(1,age)`, Plan 585):
//! feed its output as `want`. The resident STORAGE is also caller-shaped:
//! the free function [`admission_decision`] decides over caller-owned rows;
//! [`AdmissionSet`] is the convenience layer that owns rows + the fair-turn
//! sweep state. Slot allocation itself is not re-implemented here —
//! index-stable pools are [`graph_stable_pool`](crate::GraphStablePool)
//! territory (Issue 800 Arm C); this module is the *policy* over a resident
//! set, not its allocator.
//!
//! # Prior art (Issue 873 A4)
//!
//! Nearest published cousin is **TinyLFU / W-TinyLFU** (Caffeine; admission
//! by frequency-sketch candidate-vs-victim compare). Deltas, per Research
//! 581 §4: the dwell immunity window, the admission-tick clock (vs sketch
//! recency), the **terminating** fair-turn sweep (vs W-TinyLFU's permanent
//! admission window), and a multiplicative margin over arbitrary
//! caller-supplied want-scores (no sketch, no frequency assumption — works
//! over attention mass, demand predictions, or any bounded score).
//!
//! # Sync boundary
//!
//! None — pure policy over caller-owned state; no sync surfaces are touched
//! (the [`crate::kv_eviction`] posture). Decisions are deterministic in
//! `(rows, candidate_want, tick, config)`; the only floats are the
//! caller-supplied want-scores, compared with `>` against
//! `victim_want * margin` — never hashed, never committed, never synced.
//!
//! # Allocation
//!
//! [`AdmissionSet::new`] allocates once; the steady-state paths
//! (`consider`, `consider_fair`, `update_want`, `fair_turn_next`,
//! `resident_ids_into` into a caller-owned buffer) never allocate. The
//! fair-turn `had_turn` vector grows ONLY on universe growth — a cold
//! event, amortized, never on the per-cycle path.
