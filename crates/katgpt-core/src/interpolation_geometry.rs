//! Interpolation Geometry — iMAUVE + 5-way intervention probe for committed
//! latent substrates.
//!
//! Distilled from Prabhudesai & Geng, *Latent Thought Flows with Text
//! Compression* (Jun 2, 2026). See `katgpt-rs/.research/445_*.md` for the
//! research note and `katgpt-rs/.issues/158_*.md` for the PoC issue.
//!
//! # What this is
//!
//! A generic, modelless evaluation methodology for any committed latent
//! substrate (belief state `[f32; 8]`, `NeuronShard::style_weights [f32; 64]`,
//! `ArchetypeBlendShard` π, `KarcShard` weights, `ZoneGeometryPod`,
//! `MerkleFrozenEnvelope` versions — the six substrates cataloged in
//! Research 445 §2.6). It exposes two protocols distilled from the paper:
//!
//! 1. [`imauve_score`] — nearest-neighbor midpoint interpolation quality
//!    (paper §1.2). The paper's headline methodological contribution:
//!    predicts downstream generation quality with Pearson r=0.99, while
//!    reconstruction quality (rMAUVE) saturates near 1.0 and is
//!    uninformative. Our analog: a substrate can have perfect
//!    freeze/thaw bit-identity yet have midpoints that decode to
//!    incoherent intermediate behavior.
//!
//! 2. [`intervention_battery`] — 5-way causal probe (paper §1.4): matched
//!    / shuffled / zero / mean / noise. Extends Plan 278's `FaithfulnessProbe`
//!    (binary, on injected memory) to the per-entity committed-state domain.
//!
//! # What this is NOT
//!
//! - NOT a training primitive. No encoder, no decoder network, no MeanFlow
//!   generator. The trait abstracts over substrates that already exist; the
//!   caller supplies the decode operation.
//! - NOT a probability / confidence / predictive interval. The fields are
//!   raw geometric / divergence measurements. The "Report the Floor"
//!   conformal-naive rule (Research 322 / Plan 340) does NOT apply.
//! - NOT a router. The diagnostic produces measurements; the caller decides
//!   what to do with them.
//!
//! # Modelless contract
//!
//! Every operation is closed-form: nearest-neighbor search, element-wise
//! midpoint, caller-supplied decode distance. Zero training, zero backprop.
//! Per AGENTS.md, the iMAUVE metric itself is the distilled primitive —
//! the paper's training-side architectural pressures (MAE-drop, drop
//! readout prev-token context, sliding-window attention) are documented
//! in Research 445 §2.1 and correctly routed to riir-train.
//!
//! # Performance contract
//!
//! - [`imauve_score`] is `O(n² · d)` for `n` anchors × `n` candidates × `d`
//!   dimensions, with **zero allocation** in the hot path (caller-supplied
//!   scratch for the midpoint). The reference scale is `n ≤ 1024`, `d ≤ 64`
//!   — audit cadence, not per-tick.
//! - [`intervention_battery`] is `O(n · d)` for `n` donors — single pass,
//!   zero allocation.
//!
//! # Determinism
//!
//! All operations are deterministic and platform-independent: no SIMD
//! dispatch inside the math, no floating-point reordering, no RNG in the
//! scored path. The `noise()` intervention uses a caller-supplied seed
//! (deterministic Gaussian via Box-Muller over a fixed xorshift stream).

// (Module gating is handled by `#[cfg(feature = "interpolation_geometry")]`
// on the `mod` declaration in `lib.rs`; this file must NOT duplicate it.)
