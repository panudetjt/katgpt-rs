//! jsd_topk — NaN-safe bounded top-K Jensen–Shannon divergence kernel
//! (Issue 802 item 2, from Research 561 / arXiv:2609.15177 distill).
//!
//! `JSD = H(M) − ½H(P) − ½H(Q)` with `M = ½(P+Q)`, computed over the top-K
//! slice of each distribution RENORMALIZED to sum 1. The naive alternative —
//! KL over top-K zero-padded vectors — is +∞ on any disjoint support and one
//! NaN poisons every downstream gate; this kernel is bounded by construction:
//! disjoint top-K supports return EXACTLY ln 2, identical inputs return
//! exactly 0, and no input class produces NaN or ±∞.
//!
//! Prerequisite for Issue 802's commitment-gap calibration tables (1) and
//! the tri_mode graded verdicts (4). OPT-IN behind the `jsd_topk` feature.
//!
//! # Restriction semantics (per-vector top-K, union support)
//!
//! The top-K entries of P are taken by P's OWN values and the top-K of Q by
//! Q's OWN values; the union of the two index sets is the effective support.
//! Each restricted slice is renormalized to sum 1 (divide by the sum of the
//! selected K values); an index outside a side's selection contributes
//! exactly 0 restricted mass for that side, even if its raw entry is
//! positive. The kernel therefore measures the divergence of the RESTRICTED
//! objects — the Issue 802 gate semantics, where only the head of the
//! distribution matters and tail agreement is out of scope by construction.
//!
//! Ties at the K-th value are broken by the selection algorithm
//! (`select_nth_unstable_by` — deterministic for a fixed input, no
//! user-visible ordering guarantee among equal values). A tie only moves
//! which equal-valued filler entries join the union; fillers carry
//! restricted mass 0 on the selecting side and contribute nothing to the
//! divergence sum.
//!
//! # Exactness contract
//!
//! - **Disjoint restricted supports** (no union index carrying both
//!   restricted masses positive) → exactly `f32` ln 2. That predicate is the
//!   exact condition under which `H(M) = ½H(P) + ½H(Q) + ln 2` holds for
//!   normalized restricted masses, so the constant IS the mathematical value
//!   by construction of the predicate; the accumulated f32 sum only
//!   approaches it within rounding and is discarded when the predicate
//!   fires (the Issue 802 G1 test pins the bitwise equality against
//!   `f32::ln(2.0)`).
//! - **Identical inputs** → exactly `0.0`: each union term cancels exactly
//!   in f32 (see `jsd_term` — the ½-scalings are powers of two, so the
//!   shared-mass term is an exact `x − ½x − ½x`).
//! - **Both sides all-zero** → exactly `0.0` (no signal — documented
//!   convention: there is nothing to diverge).
//! - **One side all-zero** → exactly ln 2 via the same disjointness
//!   predicate: the surviving side's support shares nothing with the empty
//!   support. Honest caveat: the degenerate side is not a probability
//!   measure, so the textbook ln-2 bound does not strictly apply (the
//!   unnormalized reading would be `½H(Q) + ln 2`, which is unbounded and
//!   useless as a gate). The kernel pins the boundary constant because the
//!   Issue 802 gate consumer needs a bounded "no shared evidence" signal.
//!
//! # NaN safety
//!
//! Never returns NaN or ±∞ for finite non-negative inputs where at least
//! one restricted side has positive mass. Precondition: callers sanitize;
//! `debug_assert!` gates finiteness/non-negativity — the kernel does not
//! silently absorb garbage, and there is NO panic path in release beyond
//! the debug asserts: length mismatches truncate to the common prefix and
//! the index-encoding cap short-circuits to `0.0` (both documented below).
//! Release hardening: a non-positive or NaN restricted sum classifies as
//! the degenerate branch rather than propagating.
//!
//! # Zero-alloc contract
//!
//! [`jsd_topk_into`] is the hot path: caller-owned scratch, no heap
//! allocation. Scratch is used as an f32-ENCODED INDEX WORKSPACE (iota fill
//! → partial selection → ascending sort → two-pointer union merge); the
//! kernel never copies the input values, it reads masses by encoded index,
//! so scratch contents are clobbered and the scratch-size contract is
//! `>= input len`. Indices up to [`MAX_LEN`] = 2²⁴ are exactly representable
//! in f32; beyond the cap the kernel short-circuits to `0.0` (debug builds
//! assert instead). [`jsd_topk`] is the convenience form: it allocates two
//! `Vec`s per call, honestly and by design — allocation outside hot loops is
//! acceptable there; the G4 gate is on the INTO form.
