//! Streak-gated difficulty-ladder advancement + corrective backtracking FSM
//! (Issue 887; Research 589 — ATC, arXiv:2609.19717 §2/§6.3/App H.2).
//!
//! # The primitive
//!
//! A curriculum climbs a ladder of difficulty stages. ATC's stage controller
//! advances a stage iff the held-out accuracy at the current stage has been
//! ≥ `tau` for `streak_needed` **consecutive** evaluations — any sub-`tau`
//! evaluation resets the streak — and, on advancement, re-probes every
//! already-passed stage at its own budget: if any of them regressed below
//! `tau`, the gate **retreats to the shallowest failing stage** (argmin),
//! never the most recent, and the streak restarts there.
//!
//! The paper's own ablations (re-measure per surface — these priors price
//! the defaults, they are not claims):
//! - **Dwell dominance**: `(τ=0.9, m=5) → 99.9%` beats `(τ=0.98, m=1) →
//!   98.5%` beats `(τ=0.9, m=1) → 91.8%`. Raising `m` beats raising `τ` —
//!   a threshold below the ceiling admits a half-learned stage and the run
//!   stops there. Pinned as an ordering inequality by the tests.
//! - **Corrective backtracking under a bounded window**: 51.0% → 97.4% —
//!   the single largest ablation in the paper.
//! - **λ = 0 (no rehearsal)**: the ladder never passes stage 2 (8/8 arms) —
//!   without a rehearsal mix the retention probes catch the decayed
//!   foundation and the gate retreats forever. That is the gate DETECTING
//!   the collapse (the corrective loop is doing its job), not a gate
//!   defect; arming the escape is the trainer's `rehearsal_frac` job.
//! - **The collapse warning**: windowing/eviction of old-stage skill
//!   without retention re-verification is unsafe. This is exactly the
//!   `on_eval`-only posture the negative control (b) pins: a gate without
//!   the retention path structurally cannot red.
//!
//! # Substrate-first verdict (why this is not a parallel system)
//!
//! Research 589 §3 grepped the workspace with vocabulary translation:
//! every shipped streak gate runs the INVERSE direction (halt/suppress/
//! demote on consecutive *failures* — `gain_cost_halt::inversion_streak`,
//! riir-clippy `pair_fail_streak`, `EvidenceTier::Withdrawn`); every fade
//! mechanism is detect-only or trigger-only (riir-clippy FADED/STALLED
//! report-only; `auto_readmit` re-admits, it never retreats a pointer).
//! No stage pointer, no advance-on-streak, no argmin-retreat ships
//! anywhere — the seat is genuinely open. `hint_regret` is the regulator
//! without a generator (Research 589 §6.1 fusion candidate), not this.
//!
//! # Design decisions (pinned where the paper is silent)
//!
//! - **Retention gates the ADVANCE** (reading B): the `earlier` probes are
//!   consulted when the streak first reaches `m` — the paper's "on
//!   advancement re-probe every passed stage". A regression detected only
//!   at that moment still retreats; a gate that probes every eval would
//!   retreat earlier but violates the paper's staging.
//! - **`earlier[j]` is stage `j+1`'s probe** — the stage pointer only ever
//!   moves down by retreat and up by one-at-a-time advancement, so the
//!   stages below the current one are exactly `1..=stage-1`, contiguous.
//!   A slice whose length ≠ `stage - 1` means the caller's retention
//!   instrumentation is broken: fail-closed (retreat to stage 1 when above
//!   it), never silently advance on malformed input — the paper's own
//!   collapse warning.
//! - **Retreat at stage 1 is `Hold`**: there are no earlier stages to
//!   regress; the FSM structurally cannot emit a retreat below stage 1.
//! - **Non-finite / out-of-range accuracies reset the streak** — an
//!   untrustworthy measurement is not a confirmation (fail-closed).
//! - **`rehearsal_frac` is consumer-facing metadata** — the preventive mix
//!   fraction the TRAINER should replay of earlier-stage data (the paper's
//!   λ). The gate detects decay; it cannot prevent it. It is carried on
//!   the config so the trainer reads its marching orders and the gate's
//!   defaults stay one constant block.
//! - **No auto-demotion anywhere** — retreat re-trains; it never retires
//!   (the riir-clippy lifecycle law, Issue 102's "nothing demotes
//!   automatically").
//!
//! # Prior art
//!
//! ATC (arXiv:2609.19717) is the direct source. Nearest shipped cousins:
//! `gain_cost_halt` (streak counter, halt-not-advance), katgpt-clippy's
//! `frontier_report`/`gate_calibration`/`active_set` (detect-only halves
//! of the lifecycle), `hint_regret` (regulator, no ladder). Automated
//! Curriculum Learning's teacher-strength heuristics lack the corrective
//! backtracking; CLASSIC scores stage transfer but does not re-verify
//! passed stages. The delta is the combination: dwell-dominant streak
//! gate + argmin-shallowest corrective retreat + a preventive rehearsal
//! knob on one config.
//!
//! Zero deps, zero alloc (both paths are arithmetic over caller-owned
//! data), `#[repr(u8)]` actions for FFI/wire friendliness. Opt-in — no
//! production consumer exists yet; promotion waits on the first
//! consumer's GOAT (the 873/874/875 precedent).
