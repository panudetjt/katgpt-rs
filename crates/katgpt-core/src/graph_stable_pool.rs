//! `GraphStablePool<T>` — the append-only + free-list + never-invalidate slot
//! pool (Issue 800 Arm C).
//!
//! A DRY extraction of a contract that ships **four times under four names**
//! — an independently-rediscovered substrate, not new machinery. The narrowest
//! common contract: slot-index allocation where **allocating never invalidates
//! the indices of live elements**; a free list recycles slots; the backing
//! store grows by append only (never compacts, never reorders).
//!
//! # The four sites
//!
//! | # | Site | Slot store | Free list | Growth | Stability it actually needs |
//! |---|---|---|---|---|---|
//! | 1 | [`katgpt-kv` `radix_prefix`] `RadixPrefixTree` — `crates/katgpt-kv/src/radix_prefix/mod.rs` (nodes L155, `free_nodes` L157, LIFO pop `alloc_node` L478-484, push on evict L517) — **✅ RE-POINTED 2026-09-16** onto this type (the inline `free_nodes` stack is gone; eviction drops node values instead of parking cleared buffers) | `GraphStablePool<RadixNode>` | (pool free list), LIFO | append | **index** (node ids stable; node values move on growth) — as before |
//! | 2 | `katgpt-transformer` `PagedKVCache` — `crates/katgpt-transformer/src/kv_cache.rs` (`pages` L506, `free_pages` L510, LIFO pop `alloc_page` L550-562, push on rollback/release L709-711 + L765-767) — **⏸ RE-POINT DECLINED 2026-09-16** (contract-matched lineage, kept as-is; verdict below) | `Vec<Vec<f32>>` (heap handle per slot) | `Vec<usize>`, LIFO | append (`push`) | **index**, plus **payload address stability** via the Vec-of-Vec indirection (handles move on growth; the f32 page buffers behind them never do — "the pool never moves pages") |
//! | 3 | `riir-gpu` `Qwen38LaneSet` — `../riir-ai/crates/riir-gpu/src/qwen38_dense_cudarc.rs` (L2813-2853, `enable_lanes` L5096-5168) — **✅ N.A. 2026-09-16**: no free list, no slot churn — the set already IS the lifetime-scoped flat-arena pattern; nothing for `alloc`/`free` to own (struct doc records the verdict) | one flat `CudaSlice<f32>` per layer, `n` **fixed** lane slots via zero-copy slice views | **none** | **whole-set replacement** (drops the captured graphs together with the pointers they bake) | **true address stability** — captured CUDA graphs bake DEVICE POINTERS into the arenas (L2843-2848); achieved by allocate-once pre-allocation, not chunking |
//! | 4 | this crate's `BranchBank<E>` — `src/branching/bank.rs` (`free_slots` L47, LIFO pop L205-210, append L214-222, push on prune L302) — **⏸ RE-POINT DECLINED 2026-09-16** (wire-pinned; verdict below) | `Vec<CognitiveBranch>` by value | `Vec<u32>`, LIFO | append, capped by `max_branches` (caller policy) | **index** (`BranchId` stable) |
//!
//! # The stability verdict (read this before the name misleads you)
//!
//! This type guarantees **INDEX stability, and states it as such**: while an
//! element is live, its slot index never changes — across any sequence of
//! `alloc`/`free` calls, including growth. That is exactly what sites 1 and 4
//! consume, and it is the honest majority shape (site 2's payload guarantee is
//! a property of *its* `T` being a heap handle, see below).
//!
//! This type does **NOT** promise that a `&T` borrowed from `get` survives the
//! next `alloc`: growing the slot array reallocates it and **moves the
//! `Option<T>` slot values in memory**. Hold the index; re-borrow after each
//! alloc. A debug-mode `#[test]` in this module pins the payload-level analog:
//! when `T` is itself a heap indirection (`Vec<_>`, the site-2 recipe —
//! `pages: Vec<Vec<f32>>`), the allocation **behind** each `T` never moves,
//! because growth relocates only the 24-byte handles. That payload-stability
//! is the captured-graph property in its host terms, and it is `T`-shaped,
//! not pool-shaped: the pool never touches a live slot's payload.
//!
//! Site 3 achieves true address stability the other way — flat allocate-once
//! buffers plus whole-set replacement, with the graph cache scoped INSIDE the
//! lane set so a replaced set takes its baked pointers with it. That is a
//! lifetime-scoping discipline, not a layout, which is why the extracted type
//! does **not** adopt chunked/pinned storage: chunking would complicate the
//! API beyond what the two index-stable sites (1, 4) and the handle-stable
//! site (2) need, and site 3's guarantee does not come from chunking anyway.
//! The site-3 re-point maps to: pre-allocate with [`GraphStablePool::with_capacity`],
//! and scope any address-baked artifact to the pool's lifetime (the
//! `Qwen38LaneSet` pattern).
//!
//! # Site deltas (what the follow-up re-points must adapt — wrappers or generics)
//!
//! | Site | Delta vs this type | Adaptation on re-point |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | 1 `radix_prefix` | Nodes carry structured payloads (`tokens`/`pages`/`children` Vecs) and eviction *clears* payloads instead of taking them; free slots are recognized by `tokens.is_empty()` | **✅ DONE 2026-09-16** — node struct stored as `T`; `alloc`/`free` replace the inline pop/push; liveness is pool occupancy (the `tokens.is_empty()` zombie filter is structural now); the arena scans (LRU eviction, `total_locks`, `for_each_held_page`) consume `iter()`
//! | 2 `PagedKVCache` | Refcount layer decides when a page is freed; `alloc_page` **refills** the existing `Vec<f32>` (`fill(0.0)`) instead of replacing the handle — a buffer-recycling micro-opt | **⏸ DECLINED 2026-09-16** — the refill-at-stable-index contract forces the recycled buffers OUT of the pool between free and reuse (a side stash), turning one bookkeeping structure (`free_pages`) into two (pool free-stack + buffer stash); `pages`/`free_pages`/`page_ref_counts` are `pub` and are the measurement instrument of bench_414's legacy replica + root tests; the pool's None-on-freed safety targets a class rollback's table truncation already prevents. Lineage row stands — the pool was distilled FROM this shape; re-pointing is not what makes the claim true |
//! | 3 `Qwen38LaneSet` | No free list; fixed `n`; whole-set replacement invalidating baked pointers | **✅ N.A.** — discipline already implemented in the code (allocate-once + graphs-scoped-inside-the-set); a pool wrapper adds alloc/free nothing calls. Verdict recorded in the struct doc (riir-ai `35108b6a7`) |
//! | 4 `BranchBank` | Fixed `max_branches` cap enforced caller-side (`debug_assert` before append); flat anchor side-cache keyed by slot | **⏸ DECLINED 2026-09-16** — the wire format (`to_bytes`/`from_bytes`) pins slots-by-value with in-band `Removed` zombie slots + the EXPLICIT `free_slots` stack in order; a pool-backed rebuild cannot reproduce that byte-identity without exposing pool internals (the free-stack order is an implementation detail), and the wire feeds neuron-db freeze — a change is a versioned migration, not a refactor. Same free-list machinery verdict stands as the reason the site WAS matched |
//!
//! # API contract
//!
//! - [`alloc`](GraphStablePool::alloc) — pops the free list (**LIFO**, matching
//!   the free-list discipline of all three free-list sites: radix's former
//!   `free_nodes.pop` (now this type's own stack), `PagedKVCache::alloc_page`
//!   `free_pages.pop`, `BranchBank::free_slots.pop`), else appends and returns
//!   the new index. Writing a recycled slot replaces a `None`, so alloc never
//!   drops a stale value.
//! - [`free`](GraphStablePool::free) — takes the value out and returns it
//!   (`Option<T>`); pushes the index onto the free list. **Double-free is a
//!   silent no-op returning `None`** — the `BranchBank::prune` discipline
//!   (quiet `false` on already-removed, bank.rs L287-304), the majority
//!   defensive posture; out-of-range is likewise a silent `None`. A freed
//!   slot reads back `None` from `get`/`get_mut` — no stale-value footgun.
//! - [`get`](GraphStablePool::get) / [`get_mut`](GraphStablePool::get_mut) —
//!   `None` for out-of-range **or freed** indices.
//! - [`len`](GraphStablePool::len) — live count. [`capacity`](GraphStablePool::capacity)
//!   — total slots ever (live + free), the `PagedKVCache::total_pages` /
//!   `BranchBank::branches.len()` semantics; NOT the `Vec` backing capacity.
//!
//! Slots are `Option<T>`: zero-cost when `T` has a pointer niche (every
//! site's `T` qualifies — `Vec` handles, structs containing Vecs, slices) and
//! +1 aligned byte otherwise. This is what makes freed slots distinguishable
//! without a parallel occupancy array (radix uses `tokens.is_empty()`,
//! `PagedKVCache` uses refcounts — same job, per-site shape).
//!
//! # Zero-alloc steady state (G4)
//!
//! `alloc` / `free` / `get` / `get_mut` perform no heap allocation once the
//! working set is warm: recycled-slot writes replace in place, the free list
//! is bounded by the slot count and stops reallocating after warmup. The
//! documented exception is **amortized growth** — appending a slot beyond the
//! current backing capacity reallocates the slot array (and free-list pushes
//! realloc until its capacity covers the peak free depth), exactly the
//! exception every site accepts. An inline gate below pins 1000 churn cycles
//! at zero allocations on a pre-warmed pool.
//!
//! # Modelless + portability
//!
//! Pure index arithmetic over `std` `Vec`/`Option` — no weights, no inference,
//! no `std::arch`, no deps. wasm32-clean by construction (the whole-module
//! check runs in CI lanes).
