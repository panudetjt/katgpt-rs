//! Renoise-CE self-verifier — perturb a completed state, re-resolve through
//! the same operator, measure drift as a verifier-free correctness score.
//!
//! Distilled from Flow Reasoning Models (Helbling et al., arXiv:2606.29150).
//! Research note: `katgpt-rs/.research/369_Flow_Reasoning_Models_Renoise_CE_Self_Verifier.md`.
//! Plan: `katgpt-rs/.plans/406_renoise_ce_self_verifier.md`.
//!
//! # What this is
//!
//! A **modelless, operator-agnostic self-evaluation signal**: given a completed
//! candidate state `y`, perturb it (add noise / mask / domain-specific
//! corruption), re-resolve through the same operator `F`, and measure the
//! cross-entropy drift `d(y, F(perturb(y)))`. Correct solutions sit in stable
//! basins of the operator's dynamics → low drift. Confident mistakes sit in
//! spurious basins → high drift under perturbation. The drift IS the verifier
//! score — no external verifier, no labels, no auxiliary head.
//!
//! This is the **third orthogonal self-eval signal** alongside CLR (claim-level
//! vote, R255/P284) and CoE (trajectory geometry, R345/P342):
//! - CLR asks "do the claims check out"
//! - CoE asks "is the trajectory shape committed"
//! - Renoise-CE asks "is the output a stable fixed point under perturbation"
//!
//! With `horizon_weights` also enabled, the opt-in
//! [`renoise_ce_score_horizon`] reallocates the k-draw budget over a RANGE
//! of levels under the (T−t) remaining-horizon law (Issue 875 T2 / Research
//! 582 — low-noise draws weighted up, terminal draws ~skipped).
//!
//! With `renoise_ce_surprise` enabled, the opt-in [`renoise_ce_surprise`]
//! turns the score from self-consistency into **distributional surprise
//! against a caller-supplied frozen target** (Issue 875 T4 / Research 582 —
//! PFD's resolve-against-the-teacher variant): the perturbed candidate is
//! re-resolved and scored against the TARGET anchor, not the candidate
//! itself. Novelty that is invisible pointwise (a state at the prior's own
//! distance but in a foreign basin) becomes visible — only the flow through
//! the operator, scored against the prior, sees it. First consumer: the
//! consolidation surprise ordering (which shards enter the Raven/δ-Mem
//! sleep cycle first).
//!
//! # What this is NOT
//!
//! - **NOT a UQ primitive.** Returns a raw drift score (lower = more stable),
//!   not a calibrated probability. Any UQ claim (correctness probability,
//!   confidence interval) MUST be conformal-wrapped and beat the floor
//!   (`ConformalIntervalCalibrator<SeasonalNaiveForecaster>`, Plan 340 / Issue
//!   010). Until then, it is a **ranking signal**.
//! - **NOT a refinement step.** Unlike Q-Sample (Plan 222) which re-noises to
//!   drive toward a *better* answer, renoise-CE re-noises to *score* the
//!   current answer. The candidate is returned unchanged.
//! - **NOT the same-input comparison of Self-Advantage Gate** (Plan 283).
//!   Renoise-CE PERTURBS the input; Self-Advantage compares the same input
//!   across two passes.
//!
//! # Hot-path design
//!
//! - `RenoiseCeScore::per_draw` is a fixed `[f32; 8]` — zero allocation on the
//!   score path.
//! - `perturb` operates in-place on a cloned state (one alloc per draw,
//!   unavoidable — the caller's state must not be mutated).
//! - `re_resolve` returns an owned state.
//! - The score loop reuses a single accumulator.
//!
//! # RNG
//!
//! Uses `fastrand::Rng` (codebase convention). The trait is generic over
//! `fastrand::Rng` directly (not `impl rand::Rng`) to match the rest of
//! katgpt-core. Callers construct one with `fastrand::Rng::with_seed(...)`
//! for determinism.
