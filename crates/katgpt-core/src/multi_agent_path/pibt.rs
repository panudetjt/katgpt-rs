//! PIBT — Priority Inheritance with Backtracking (Plan 440 T1.4, Issue 143).
//!
//! Distilled from Okumura et al. 2022 (*PIBT: Scalable and Prioritization
//! Planning for Multi-Agent Pathfinding*). PIBT is a one-step collision-free
//! joint action generator: given the current joint configuration and per-agent
//! guidance, produce a next-position for every agent. Edge collisions (swaps)
//! are prevented by construction; vertex collisions are prevented on
//! uncongested maps but may occur on congested maps (see §"Collision profile"
//! below for the tradeoff analysis).
//!
//! The lexicographic cost for agent `i` considering move to `u`:
//!
//! ```text
//! ⟨ Ind[Φ[i][0] ≠ u], dist(u, g_i), hindrance(i→u), ε ⟩
//! ```
//!
//! I.e. PIBT first prefers moves consistent with the guidance, then
//! goal-direction, then low hindrance, then random tiebreak.
//!
//! # Implementation: greedy PIBT + swap technique + LaCAM escalation
//!
//! The inner loop is the **greedy PIBT**: agents are processed in priority
//! order, each taking the first collision-free candidate. Later agents see
//! earlier agents' committed positions and adapt. This is aggressive (agents
//! don't wait for undecided occupants) and has high throughput on open maps.
//!
//! Issue 144 adds the **swap technique** (Okumura 2023a, arXiv:2309.02425):
//! when two agents face a head-on corridor deadlock (agent i wants j's cell,
//! j wants i's cell), the lower-priority agent uses reverse scoring to back
//! up, letting the higher-priority agent pass. This directly targets the
//! ht_chantry maze-map deadlock where local priority shuffling cannot help
//! because someone must yield.
//!
//! Issue 143 adds **LaCAM escalation** as an outer loop: when the greedy PIBT
//! produces stuck agents (deadlocks on maze maps), the escalation retries with
//! shuffled priority orderings. This breaks symmetric deadlocks without
//! degrading the fast path on open maps.
//!
//! ## Why not recursive priority inheritance?
//!
//! Issue 140 and Issue 143 both tested recursive priority inheritance (where
//! a high-priority agent evicts undecided occupants from their cells). Both
//! found it **collapses throughput** (empty-48-48 dropped from 18.6 → 1.5,
//! -92%) because the eviction forces agents to move away from their goals,
//! creating cascading stalls. The greedy variant — which lets agents
//! compromise by taking their next-best cell — has dramatically higher
//! collective throughput in the lifelong MAPF setting. The recursive variant
//! is the right algorithm for one-shot MAPF (where finding ANY solution is
//! the goal), but wrong for lifelong MAPF (where sustained throughput is the
//! goal).
//!
//! # Collision profile
//!
//! - **Vertex collisions**: PREVENTED on uncongested maps. On congested maps,
//!   stuck agents (no collision-free move AND current cell committed by a
//!   higher-priority agent) are forced to wait in place, which can produce a
//!   vertex collision. This is a deliberate throughput tradeoff documented
//!   below (§"Why not recursive priority inheritance?") and measured in
//!   `riir-ai/.benchmarks/516_g6c_collision_freedom_delta.md` (62.5% of
//!   congested-map ticks have vertex collisions on the G6 scenario). Plan 453
//!   (bounded one-step LaCAM escalation, behind the `lacam_escalation` feature)
//!   resolves this — the constraint tree + recursive PIBT eliminates vertex
//!   collisions entirely (G-col = 0.0%); the original Issue 154 analysis is
//!   closed as fixed by Plan 453.
//! - **Edge collisions (swaps)**: PREVENTED by construction. The greedy pass
//!   explicitly checks `A→B` and `B→A` simultaneously and rejects swap moves.
//!
//! # Output
//!
//! Returns `Ok(JointAction)` — always succeeds. Stuck agents wait in place
//! (which may vertex-collide on congested maps; see above). The caller may
//! inspect the result for collisions and congestion, and escalate further if
//! needed. For lifelong MAPF, temporary stalls and rare vertex collisions
//! are tolerated as the lesser evil vs the throughput collapse caused by
//! all-wait or recursive priority inheritance.
//!
//! # Determinism
//!
//! The random tiebreak `ε` uses a deterministic seeded RNG, preserving replay.
