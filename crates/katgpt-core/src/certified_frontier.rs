//! distilling De Santi et al., *Active Flow Expansion for Out-of-Distribution
//! Discovery*, [arXiv:2606.08802](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.08802). The
//! operator itself is the SAFEOPT lineage (Sui et al. 2015/2018) — known art,
//! shipped here the way this repo ships bandits: the operator is standard, the
//! fusion (grow-then-navigate with [`crate::viable_manifold_graph`]) and the
//! modelless framing are the contribution.
//!
//! Plan 580 Phase 1. Feature `certified_frontier`, std-only, zero deps.
//!
//! # What this is
//!
//! Given (a) a buffer of **binary verifier outcomes** per latent cell, (b) a
//! closed-form uncertainty model, and (c) an a-priori **Lipschitz budget**,
//! grow a set of cells that provably satisfy `p(z) >= h`, and answer two
//! questions the caller cannot answer alone:
//!
//! - *Where do I look next?* — [`CertifiedFrontier::acquire_frontier_target`]
//! - *When do I stop looking?* — [`should_advance`]
//!
//! Everything is GD-free: no training, no backprop. Weight-free by
//! construction — the "model" is a Beta-Bernoulli count per cell plus an
//! optional linear-kernel posterior variance.
//!
//! # Phase 0 measured this before it was built
//!
//! [Bench 687](../../../.benchmarks/687_certified_frontier_phase0_poc.md):
//! zero soundness violations, monotone growth, and **51.4x** separation of
//! frontier acquisition over passive sampling at an identical query budget.
//!
//! The same PoC measured something the plan did not ask, and it shapes this
//! API (T0.3): **the Lipschitz dilation is conditional, not free.** A hop is
//! admissible iff `best_cb - h >= L * spacing`, so on a coarse lattice
//! [`CertifiedFrontier::reachability_dilation`] relaxes and certifies
//! *nothing*, silently. That is why [`CertifiedFrontier::dilation_feasibility`]
//! is a first-class, cheap predicate rather than a debug aid: a caller must be
//! able to see a dead dilation without instrumenting a run. Measured crossover
//! (dense world, 6 000 queries, 0 violations throughout): 16x16 and 32x32
//! certify 0 cells by dilation; 64x64 certifies 6; 96x96 certifies 30 of 113
//! (27%). The predicted and observed crossovers agree on all four points.
//!
//! The cause is that a *global* Lipschitz constant charges a plateau hop the
//! steepest-cliff price — and the paper's `L = L_s * L_g` is global in exactly
//! the same way, so this is not an artifact of the Beta substitute. Hence
//! [`FrontierCell::lipschitz`]: a caller with a tighter **a-priori** bound for
//! a region supplies it per cell, and hops pay `max(L_from, L_to)`.
//!
//! # Soundness contract (read before setting `lipschitz`)
//!
//! `cfg.lipschitz` and `FrontierCell::lipschitz` MUST be **a-priori upper
//! bounds** on the local Lipschitz constant of `p` in probability space. They
//! are the one input this module cannot check. Estimating `L` from the same
//! observations that drive expansion is **unsound** — a too-small `L` makes
//! [`CertifiedFrontier::reachability_dilation`] certify cells that are not
//! valid, and no test in this module can see it. The uncertainty model is
//! conservative; the Lipschitz budget is the caller's proof obligation.
