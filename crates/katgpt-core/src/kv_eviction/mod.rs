//! Usage-rate (mass/age) KV eviction scoring + the generation-runaway canary
//! (Plan 585, Research 523, arXiv:2608.19920 "Learning how to Forget",
//! Seeger et al., AWS 2026).
//!
//! # The score
//!
//! Raw H2O evicts by cumulative attention mass, which is monotonically
//! biased toward residency age: an old-but-cold row (0.001 mass/step × 1000
//! steps) carries the same cumulative mass as a young-but-hot row (0.5/step
//! × 2). The paper's normalized score converts cumulative evidence into a
//! per-step usage rate:
//!
//! ```text
//! score(row, tick) = cum_mass / max(1, tick - admission_tick)
//! ```
//!
//! O(1) per row per step: `observe` accumulates the caller-supplied
//! attention-mass increment; `score` is one divide. **The signal is
//! caller-supplied** (the `causal_head_importance::suspect_indices` house
//! pattern) — katgpt-core stays leaf-clean; mass producers are consumer-side
//! (riir-gpu kernel byproduct, filed as riir-ai Issue 836, pull-gated on this
//! plan's GOAT).
//!
//! # Per-(b,h) by construction
//!
//! The original H2O sums scores across batch before selecting — a pure
//! coarsening, since each head owns its rows. Here the caller slices per
//! (batch, head); nothing in this module crosses that boundary, and
//! [`select_evict`] takes exactly one head's slice.
//!
//! # Sync boundary
//!
//! None — pure scoring over caller-owned state; no sync surfaces are touched.
//!
//! # The canary (Phase 2)
//!
//! [`RunawayStats`] + [`runaway_gate`] encode the paper's R/p128
//! generation-runaway diagnostic as a promotion gate: **any lossy KV policy
//! (eviction / quantization / compaction) promoted to default MUST pass this
//! gate on a sealed long-context eval.** This extends the Issue 750
//! lossy-surface rule (aggregate perplexity can be flat while family-
//! conditional behavior flips) to the generation axis: the runaway signature
//! (output length running to the cap) is invisible to perplexity-style
//! metrics and to tolerant substring metrics — the paper measured 35–128×
//! output/target blowups while SubEM read fine.
//!
//! # The null-policy bar (Plan 585 addendum T3.9, Research 531)
//!
//! Research 531 (arXiv:2609.03430 "Random Attention") supplies the control
//! every scored evictor lacked: prompt-pinned per-head uniform-random
//! eviction — no score at all — matches the strongest scored baselines at
//! matched budget, because most of the inter-selector gap is keystone
//! protection, not the signal. [`beats_random_prompt_pin`] encodes the
//! resulting promotion bar: **a scored policy keeps its slot only if its
//! recall strictly exceeds the pinned-random null's at matched budget** —
//! at equal recall the null wins on cost (the paper's +32–43% serving
//! margin: it reads nothing), so a tie does not keep a scorer alive. Run
//! it AFTER the protection factorial (Bench 697 T3.7): if the policy's
//! recall deficit is explained by keystone loss, fix protection first —
//! the recall comparison is only meaningful at matched protection.
