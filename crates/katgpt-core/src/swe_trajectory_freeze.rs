//! SWE Trajectory Freezer — modelless committed freeze of an inference
//! attempt's trajectory geometry (Proposal 011 Phase 5, Task T5.5).
//!
//! Composes three shipped DEFAULT-ON primitives:
//!
//! - [`crate::latent_trajectory_geometry::from_states`] — the probe-free
//!   geometric diagnostic (length + mean curvature + min adjacent cosine).
//! - [`crate::committed_field_blend::CommittedFieldBlend`] — sampling-
//!   invariant per-entity MoE with sigmoid projection onto direction vectors
//!   and a BLAKE3 commitment.
//! - A local lightweight BLAKE3 envelope ([`TrajectoryFreezeEnvelope`])
//!   wrapping the frozen blend + summary + geometry. This matches the
//!   `MerkleFrozenEnvelope` pattern referenced across katgpt-core, but lives
//!   here instead of pulling a cross-repo dep on `riir-neuron-db` (the
//!   facade constraint forbids that, and this primitive is a generic open
//!   layer).
//!
//! # What this primitive is for
//!
//! A Rust-SWE-bench inference attempt (or any "iterative refinement" loop —
//! MCTS over patch proposals, repeated forward passes on evolving drafts, a
//! tf_loop rollout) leaves a trajectory through latent/patch space. The
//! geometry of that trajectory (how much it drifts, how sharply it turns,
//! whether it oscillates between attractors) is a modelless signal that can
//! be used to:
//!
//! 1. Discriminate failure modes (T5.1: oscillation vs committed-wrong vs
//!    converged-correct produce measurably distinct `(length, curvature)`
//!    signatures — `mean_curvature ≈ π` is the ping-pong signature).
//! 2. Produce a frozen, BLAKE3-committed, sampling-invariant archetype blend
//!    that characterizes *which* failure mode the attempt exhibited (T5.3b:
//!    data-derived directions from cluster centroids of geometry-encoded
//!    summaries → 100% probe accuracy on synthetic trajectories).
//! 3. Discriminate across snapshots/models (T5.6 G5 gate — the open
//!    question this primitive is built to answer).
//!
//! # The two-stage commit pipeline
//!
//! ```text
//! Stage 1 — Fit (offline, per-snapshot):  train_summaries → derive_directions
//! Stage 2 — Freeze (online, per-attempt): trajectory → encode_summary → commit
//! ```
//!
//! **Stage 1** consumes a corpus of training summaries (one per observed
//! attempt, labeled by failure mode) and produces `N` archetype direction
//! vectors via nearest-centroid derivation:
//!
//! ```text
//! direction_k = normalize( centroid_k − global_centroid )
//! ```
//!
//! This is the **T5.3b design constraint** encoded in code: archetype
//! directions MUST be data-derived, not random. Random directions hit the
//! concentration-of-measure failure (T5.3): in high-D, random unit vectors
//! are nearly orthogonal to any fixed summary, so `dot(summary, dir_k) ≈ 0`
//! for all k → degenerate uniform blend.
//!
//! **Stage 2** takes a single attempt's trajectory, computes its geometry
//! via `from_states`, encodes that geometry into a fixed-`D` summary via
//! [`GeometrySummaryEncoder`], projects onto the pre-fit directions via
//! FAME's sigmoid projection, and produces a [`FrozenAttempt`] carrying the
//! committed `CommittedFieldBlend` + the envelope.
//!
//! # The summary encoder (load-bearing per T5.3b)
//!
//! [`GeometrySummaryEncoder`] places four normalized geometry features
//! (length, curvature, min cosine, n_steps) into the summary, replicated
//! across blocks for dot-product stability. This is the **T5.3b design
//! constraint** encoded in code: the summary MUST capture failure-mode-
//! discriminative geometry, NOT just raw latent position. The dual-strategy
//! test in T5.3b proved endpoint-position summaries produce 17% accuracy
//! (vs 100% for geometry summaries) — the encoder is the load-bearing piece.
//!
//! # Const generics
//!
//! - `N` — archetype count (number of failure modes to discriminate).
//!   Production case is `N = 3` (oscillation / committed-wrong /
//!   converged-correct).
//! - `D` — summary dimension. Must be `>= 4` (the encoder writes 4 features
//!   per block). Production case is `D = 32` (matches FAME's
//!   `TriArchetypeBlend`).
//!
//! # Feature gate
//!
//! Gated behind `swe_trajectory_freeze`. Implies `latent_trajectory_geometry`
//! + `committed_field_blend` (both already default-on). Opt-in — this is a
//! research-validation primitive (Proposal 011 Phase 5); promotion to
//! default requires the T5.6 G5 gate (cross-snapshot discrimination) to
//! pass on real model trajectories, which is currently PARTIAL (T5.4 G3
//! FAIL at 29% on Kimi-K3 depth trajectories — see
//! `.benchmarks/012_kimi_k3_trajectory_geometry.md`).
//!
//! # Allocation
//!
//! - [`GeometrySummaryEncoder::encode_into`] — zero-alloc (writes into a
//!   caller-supplied `&mut [f32; D]`).
//! - [`derive_directions`] — allocates one `[ центroids; N ]` on the stack
//!   (compile-time fixed) + writes into caller-supplied `&mut [[f32; D]; N]`.
//!   No heap allocation.
//! - [`SweTrajectoryFreezer::freeze_attempt`] — zero-alloc. The envelope
//!   payload is written into a stack-fixed `[u8; 512]` buffer (max payload
//!   at N=3, D=32 is 154 bytes); `from_states` + `encode_into` + FAME
//!   `commit` are all documented zero-alloc.
