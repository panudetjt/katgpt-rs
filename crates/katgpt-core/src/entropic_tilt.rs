//! Entropic (max-seeking) advantage tilt — the TTT-Discover within-batch
//! objective as shared, modelless math.
//!
//! Source: arXiv:2601.16175 "Learning to Discover at Test Time"
//! (TTT-Discover), distilled at `.research/019_TTT_Discover_Test_Time_Training.md`.
//! The objective itself is published prior art (RS-GRPO arXiv:2509.24261,
//! RSPO arXiv:2508.01174) — this module transfers it, it does not claim it.
//!
//! ## Why it lives here
//!
//! Two consumers need the identical arithmetic and must not fork it:
//!
//! - **riir-clippy** (`selection_entropic`, Issue 026) — candidate selection
//!   over a heal pool; consumes the batch form and maps through `sigmoid`.
//! - **riir-train** (`loss_grpo`, Plan 341) — the GRPO advantage estimator for
//!   game self-play; consumes the leave-one-out form.
//!
//! riir-clippy shipped first and this module is the hoist mandated by Plan 341
//! ("do NOT duplicate past one implementation + one import").
//!
//! ## Mechanism
//!
//! ```text
//! q_β(i) = exp(β·r_i) / Σ_j exp(β·r_j)      (tilted distribution)
//! w_β(i) = n · q_β(i)                        (weights, mean 1 over the group)
//! A_β(i) = w_β(i) − 1                        (advantages, sum 0)
//! ```
//!
//! with β solved per group by bisection so the tilt stays within a KL budget:
//! `KL(q_β ‖ uniform) = γ` (the paper's default `γ = ln 2`).
//!
//! Auto-adaptation is the point: a group of consistent small improvements
//! permits a large β (aggressive max-seeking — tiny gaps get amplified into
//! decisive credit); an outlier-dominated group forces small β, and the budget
//! bounds the maximum weight regardless of gap magnitude (one lucky rollout
//! cannot own the update). The tilt is shift/scale invariant in the rewards
//! (`r → a·r + b` yields identical advantages — paper Appendix A.1).
//!
//! ## Batch vs leave-one-out
//!
//! [`tilt_advantages_into`] uses the batch denominator `Σ_j` (includes self);
//! [`tilt_advantages_loo_into`] uses `Σ_{j≠i}` (paper A.1).
//!
//! Which one is correct depends on what the consumer does with the output:
//!
//! - **Ranking-only consumers** (riir-clippy's argmax blend) may use either —
//!   both forms are strictly monotone in `r_i` within a fixed group, so the
//!   induced ordering is identical.
//! - **Gradient-scaling consumers** (GRPO) should prefer LOO: the advantage
//!   *magnitude* multiplies the policy gradient, and the batch form leaks the
//!   sample's own reward into its own baseline. That self-contribution biases
//!   the estimator toward zero, and the bias is `O(1/n)` — negligible for large
//!   groups, material at the group sizes self-play actually uses (K = 8–16).
//!
//! **LOO is not zero-sum.** The batch form satisfies `Σ_i A_i = 0` by
//! construction (`Σ_i w_i = n`); removing the self term from each denominator
//! breaks that identity. This is expected — LOO is a debiased estimator, not a
//! centered one — and callers that rely on zero-sum must use the batch form.
//!
//! ## Why a softmax normalization here does not violate the house
//! sigmoid-not-softmax rule
//!
//! The rule targets ROUTING/GATING decisions where softmax forces exclusive
//! competition between additive gates. Here the Boltzmann normalization is the
//! published objective's tilting mechanism, and its output is an ADVANTAGE
//! (signed, zero-sum over the group — not a competing gate).
