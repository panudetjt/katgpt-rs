//! `ConvergenceCadence` — windowed update-magnitude outcome classifier
//! (Issue 720 T1; source: Research 529, HRM mechanistic dissection,
//! Rodrigues & Kang, "Dissecting Hierarchical Reasoning Models", ICML 2026
//! Mech Interp Workshop — Finding 4, n=93/107 runs).
//!
//! # The signal
//!
//! On an iterative refinement loop, the **windowed trajectory of update
//! magnitudes** classifies the run's outcome long before the final step:
//!
//! | window tail | solved | failed |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | ‖Δz‖ at step 7-8 | **0.30** (decayed to fixed point) | **1.46** (~4.9× — plateaued HIGH) |
//! | consecutive-state cos | → 0.998 | stalls ~0.97 |
//! | consecutive-update cos | ≈ 0 | ≈ 0 (rotational churn) |
//!
//! Solved runs **decay**; failed runs **plateau high**. The shape — not any
//! single value — is the classifier.
//!
//! # What this is NOT (the signal-diff, pinned from the issue)
//!
//! - **NOT a halt signal.** [`crate::gain_cost_halt::GainCostLoopHalter`]
//!   (Plan 304 / Research 282) consumes step size ‖Δh‖ for HALT only
//!   (decay = concavity stop, growth = expansion stop). Halting ≠
//!   classification: a plateau-high run eventually halts, but the caller
//!   cannot tell "nothing left to gain" from "stuck churning — escalate".
//!   This probe is the **outcome read** the halter lacks.
//! - **NOT a novelty signal.** `DerivativeCuriosity` / `TemporalDerivativeKernel`
//!   (Plan 277) reads churn as *interesting* (explore). Here churn is
//!   *failing* (abstain/escalate). Different axis, same deltas.
//! - **NOT anti-cheat / NOT a sync surface.** Think-brain telemetry only
//!   (AGENTS.md domain rules); never crosses a SyncBlock.
//!
//! # The three laws (Research 529 §Paper × R35 × 717 × 304 — recorded here
//! per Issue 720 T4b so every consumer inherits them)
//!
//! 1. **Absolute update magnitude, never relative.** Relative residuals are
//!    a growing-denominator trap on non-fixed-point recurrences (R35's
//!    negative half; Issue 717 T6). Both verdicts here are gated by
//!    **absolute floors**; the decay ratio only discriminates *shape*
//!    between them.
//! 2. **Windowed trajectory shape, not a single-step threshold.** Plateau
//!    vs decay is a shape over a window (two half-window means), not one
//!    observation.
//! 3. **Tangential-first before radial damping.** Successive updates are
//!    near-orthogonal (cos_updates ≈ 0) — plateau churn is *rotational*,
//!    so when this probe flags Churning, scale the tangential component
//!    (Issue 717 T4) before damping the radial one.
//!
//! # Consumers (Issue 720)
//!
//! - `GainCostLoopHalter` callers — halt + outcome escalation arm.
//! - Issue 717 T3/T4 — cadence is the degradation DETECTOR its damping
//!   knob lacked ("don't damp unless inference already degrades").
//! - Per-NPC belief loops (`evolve_belief`) — settled → early-commit;
//!   churning → deliberate (riir-mmorpg-examples Issue 054 L2, T3).
//! - Consolidation-side sibling: riir-neuron-db `can_freeze` validates the
//!   same convergence finding at measure time; this probe makes it a live
//!   predictor.
//!
//! # Zero-alloc contract (G4)
//!
//! Fixed `[f32; K]` ring, `Copy` verdicts, O(1) `push`/`classify`. No heap,
//! no slices of caller state — the caller feeds the norm it already computed
//! (e.g. [`crate::gain_cost_halt::step_size`]'s return value).
//!
//! # Non-finite input policy
//!
//! A non-finite norm is a pathological signal and is counted as HIGH (it
//! feeds the plateau run and can only push the verdict toward
//! [`CadenceVerdict::Churning`]). A non-finite window mean classifies as
//! [`CadenceVerdict::Churning`] — loud, never a silent `Settled`.

// ── Issue 731 T1 — the loop residual-exit probe ─────────────────────────

/// Residual-gated early exit for a weight-tied looped forward (Issue 731 T1;
/// EqR action item 7.2 — arXiv:2605.21488 Equilibrium Reasoners).
///
/// The probe consumes the loop's per-iteration step norm ‖h_τ − h_{τ−1}‖ and
/// decides EXIT when EITHER arm fires (never before [`LoopResidualExit::d_min`]
/// completed iterations):
///
/// 1. **magnitude arm** — the mean of the last `L = 3` step norms drops below
///    the configured `tau` (EqR's window-L residual exit);
/// 2. **shape arm** — the underlying [`ConvergenceCadence`] window classifies
///    [`CadenceVerdict::Settled`] (the Research-529 decay-shape read).
///
/// Research-440 guard (the growing-denominator trap) — **CORRECTED by Issue
/// 731 T6; the original claim was false.** What T1 claimed: "the magnitude arm
/// is ABSOLUTE and the shape arm rides alongside it, so a loop whose state
/// norm grows while its step norm plateaus can never exit spuriously, because
/// arm 2's absolute floors gate the verdict." That reasoning does not hold,
/// because **the arms are OR'd, not AND'd**: arm 2 can fire alone, and arm
/// 2's rule-3 decay fall-through (`newer/older < decay_ratio_max` ⇒
/// `Settled`) carries NO absolute floor at all — law 2 is scale-invariant by
/// design. On the K = 4 window a half-window is 2 samples, so a single 2-vs-2
/// DIP inside a high plateau reads as decay and no calibration of the
/// absolute floors can suppress it. Measured, held-out fixture seed 1003
/// (T6): the InterLoopNorm negative control fired 40 times over 8 τ × 27
/// inputs, identically from `settle_floor` 0.5 down to 1e-5.
///
/// What actually guards the trap, therefore, is **three** things, and the
/// third is the T6 fix: (a) the magnitude arm's absolute τ; (b) the shape
/// arm's absolute floors, calibrated per consumer via
/// [`Self::with_cadence_config`] — these govern rules 1 and 2 only; and (c)
/// [`Self::with_shape_persistence`] — the shape arm requires
/// [`DEFAULT_SHAPE_PERSISTENCE`] CONSECUTIVE `Settled` windows, which is what
/// distinguishes a dip from a decay and is orthogonal to calibration.
/// A magnitude-ONLY arm is the T2 negative control, expected to fail
/// calibration; it is not what this probe ships.
///
/// Zero-alloc contract (G4): fixed `[f32; 3]` + `[f32; 4]` windows plus two
/// `u32` counters, no heap.
/// Non-finite norms never satisfy arm 1 (NaN comparisons are false) and count
/// HIGH in the cadence — pathological input can delay an exit, never force
/// one.
///
