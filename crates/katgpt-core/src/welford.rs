//! Welford online variance accumulator — the crate's ONE definition.
//!
//! Moved here (Plan: reflex 008 / Issue 055 substrate pass, 2026-09-30) from
//! `karc::regime_gate`'s feature-gated `imp` module so a second substrate
//! consumer (`perturbation_ensemble`) can reach it without dragging the
//! `karc_regime_gate` feature chain (`karc_forecaster +
//! conformal_predictive_intervals`) into consumers that want only moments.
//! `karc::regime_gate` re-exports it — both historical paths still resolve;
//! there is exactly one definition (the `rating` promotion precedent).
//!
//! Tracks `(count, mean, M2)` per Welford 1962. Variance = `M2 / (n − 1)`
//! (sample variance); returns `None` until two observations are accumulated.
//!
//! NaN inputs are silently rejected (no state change) so callers stay
//! well-defined during cold-start (one forecaster has no forecast yet, one
//! ensemble sample produced no score).
//!
