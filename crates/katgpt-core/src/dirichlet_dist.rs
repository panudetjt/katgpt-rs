//! Dirichlet-distribution primitives — the exact explore dial, the thinning
//! transition, and Dirichlet-EMA belief memory (Issue 912 T2+T3, Research 596).
//!
//! Source: [Research 596](../../.research/596_Simplex_Diffusion_Models.md) —
//! arXiv:2609.35553 "Simplex Diffusion Models" (the thinning/EMA propositions
//! are classical; the paper disclaims originality). Opt-in
//! (`dirichlet_dist`, default-off). All hot paths are allocation-free and
//! log-space — see "Why log space" below.
//!
//! # The three operators
//!
//! 1. **[`sample_conc_into`] — the exact explore dial.** Given a belief
//!    vector `p`, draw `Y ~ Dir(c·p)`. `E[Y] = p` **exactly by
//!    construction** (`c` = Σα is the concentration and drops out of the
//!    mean), `Var[Y_i] = p_i(1−p_i)/(c+1)`, `Cov[Y_i,Y_j] =
//!    −p_i·p_j/(c+1)`. This is the operator for "K noisy copies of a
//!    categorical belief"; the designer-facing knob is `c = 1/ν − 1` with
//!    ν ∈ (0,1) the variance fraction.
//! 2. **[`thinning_into`] — the Dirichlet thinning transition** (Prop A.2):
//!    `X ~ Dir(α)`, independent `B_i ~ Beta(ρα_i, (1−ρ)α_i)` ⇒
//!    `Y_i = B_iX_i/ΣB_jX_j ~ Dir(ρα)`. **Exact ONLY under Dirichlet input
//!    with the same `α`** — NOT mean-preserving on a fixed vector `p`
//!    (Jensen bias toward uniform: `p=(0.9,0.07,0.03)`, `c=2`, `ρ=0.5` ⇒
//!    `E[Y]=(0.847,0.103,0.051)`; pinned by
//!    `g1_thinning_fixed_vector_not_mean_preserving`). The per-coordinate
//!    variance ratio under a Dirichlet input is `(c+1)/(ρc+1)`, NOT ρ.
//! 3. **[`DirichletEma`] — belief memory** (Prop E.1 + Cor E.1): memory
//!    weights `L ~ Dir(ε·shares)` over the last `M` predictions under a
//!    geometric schedule. `E[L_j] = share_j` — deterministic and
//!    ε-independent; `Var[L_j] = ε·share_j(1−share_j)/(ε+1) → 0` as
//!    ε→∞ (deterministic weights) and the draw concentrates on vertices as
//!    ε→0 (resample-from-history). A finite ring TRUNCATES the infinite EMA
//!    tail — the `L_{i,M}` residual mass is named, not hidden: the drawn
//!    path's expectation is the RING closed form (normalized truncated
//!    geometric shares), deliberately NOT the recursive `h`, which retains
//!    the infinite tail (`E[drawn] − h = the truncated mass by
//!    construction`, so a consistency test against the recursive path would
//!    fail by design).
//!
//! # Why log space
//!
//! The Issue 912 T1 repair in `data_probe/markov.rs` draws the small-α boost
//! `U^{1/α}` in linear f32 — for α ≲ 0.02 that exponent underflows toward
//! the uniform fallback (the OPPOSITE of peaked). This module samples every
//! Gamma variate's LOGARITHM: the small-α boost becomes `ln(U)/α` (exact, no
//! underflow anywhere in the draw), and normalization is log-sum-exp.
//! Coordinates whose true probability is below f32's minimum still round to
//! 0.0 in the OUTPUT — correctly — but the draw itself never loses the
//! distribution's shape. G1 grid case C exercises α_min = 0.01, exactly
//! where the linear-space limit bites.
//!
//! # Consumers (T4 notes — documented candidates, NO wiring in this issue)
//!
//! - `perturbation_ensemble` (Bernoulli bucket dropout, heuristic law) — an
//!   interface-swap arm to the exact categorical noiser; G3 = `U_pair`
//!   stats no-regress on the existing rig. NOTE: reflex Bench 092 measured
//!   the perturbation-ensemble *confidence-ranking* use NEGATIVE — this
//!   lane claims only exploration/diversity uses, not UQ-for-confidence.
//! - `katgpt-sense` `evolve_belief_additive` sibling — G3 = mean-path
//!   bit-identical at ε=∞ (the recursive `h` routing is exactly that path).
//! - riir-neuron-db Raven/δ-Mem consolidation randomized merge weights
//!   ("uniform averaging has no attention-shift mechanism by design") —
//!   a mean-exact attention shift; their gate, their repo.
//! - `bom_arena` hypothesis sampler alternative (`sample_conc_into` vs the
//!   Gaussian/QMC hypothesis sampling) — their gate, their repo.
//!
//! # Explicit non-claims
//!
//! No coverage/prediction-interval claim → the conformal-naive floor does
//! NOT bind these primitives; it binds any future consumer that claims
//! calibrated uncertainty. No default-on promotion. Thinning is NOT claimed
//! as a general mean-preserving operator.
