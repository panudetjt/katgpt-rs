//! Per-option centroid-cosine scoring over a fixed option table —
//! katgpt-rs Plan 607 T1, the modelless game-decision lane's scoring
//! primitive (opt-in `state_option_scoring`).
//!
//! # The shape being upstreamed
//!
//! riir-reflex `engine.rs` `route_terms` (Issue 004 T7): each decision
//! option carries a corpus centroid; the state is embedded; per-option
//! `sigmoid(dot(state, centroid) · ROUTE_SCALE)` ranks the options and the
//! argmax decides. Reflex measured WHY the byte-level drafter cannot do
//! this job (a short option encoding never moves a long shared context's
//! compressed length → every option ties → constant pick), and this module
//! carries the fix upstream as a generic primitive: **centroid-cosine
//! scoring only** — the compression drafter stays out of the per-decision
//! loop (Plan 607 R3, decided at the plan, never a number relaxed later).
//!
//! # Generic by law (R4)
//!
//! The surface takes `(state vector, option matrix)` — nothing
//! arena-specific in katgpt-core (a public upstream surface is not shaped
//! by one consumer). The first consumer embeds its domain's sentences into
//! vectors elsewhere and hands the vectors here; embedding is deliberately
//! NOT this module's job.
//!
//! # Contracts
//!
//! - **Sigmoid, never softmax** — per-option scores are independent
//!   [`exact_sigmoid`] projections (the Issue-870 exact form), never a
//!   normalized group distribution.
//! - **Pinned tie-break** — argmax ties go to the LOWEST index
//!   ([`cmp_for_max`] + reverse-index comparator, the same shape
//!   `pick_domain` uses). This is the exact tie-break the Plan 607 oracle
//!   fixture pins (lowest-index on equal p_clean); a scorer that broke ties
//!   differently would disagree with the oracle on honest equivalences.
//! - **Zero-alloc** — table build, scoring and the argmax are all
//!   stack-local folds. The G4 gate is the separate
//!   `state_option_scoring_alloc_check` binary (the `*_alloc_check`
//!   convention: a counting allocator would pick up sibling tests in a
//!   shared binary).
//! - **Determinism** — the unit-normalized table IS the scoring state:
//!   same input rows → bit-identical table (sequential folds, no SIMD
//!   reduction reordering, no RNG). The GOAT prints a BLAKE3 over the
//!   table bytes; two runs / two boxes must agree.
//!
//! # Unit normalization
//!
//! Both the state and every row are unit-normalized (the
//! `distance_abstain` idiom — this module CONSUMES that implementation via
//! the feature implication rather than forking a bit-parity-critical
//! numeric helper), so the dot product is a true cosine in [−1, 1] and the
//! score is `exact_sigmoid(scale · cos)` in (0, 1). A zero vector passes
//! through normalization: "no direction" reads as cosine 0 against
//! everything, never NaN.
