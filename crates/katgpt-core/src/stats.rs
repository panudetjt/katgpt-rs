//! Nearest-rank percentiles with tail support — the workspace's one
//! percentile-of-record helper (promoted from five in-stack copies,
//! riir-ai Issue 861 T4 → the 5th-copy trigger → this module).
//!
//! The defect this shape exists to prevent: `sorted[(n * p) as usize]`
//! and `sorted[n * 99 / 100]` both land on `n - 1` — the **maximum** —
//! for every `n <= 1/(1-p)` (n ≤ 100 at p99, n ≤ 20 at p95, n ≤ 1000
//! at p999). Below that boundary the site reports one observation under
//! a percentile's name, and a `.min(len - 1)` clamp prevents a panic,
//! not a wrong statistic. A `p99 < budget` assert built on the naive
//! index becomes *stricter* (false RED), but it can no longer notice a
//! real regression: the tail is decided by a single sample.
//!
//! The quantity this helper returns alongside the value is **tail
//! support** = `n - idx`: the number of samples at or above the
//! reported rank (1 at n=100/p99, 2 at n=200, 10 at n=1000). Anything
//! under 10 is weak whether or not it is degenerate — print it, don't
//! hide it (the riir-ai Issue 853 T3 discipline).
//!
//! Contract:
//!
//! - `sorted` MUST be pre-sorted ascending by the caller (the helper
//!   indexes; it never compares, so it is generic over the element and
//!   float callers keep their own `total_cmp` sort — NaN placement is
//!   the caller's ordering decision, see
//!   [`crate::float_order`]). An unsorted slice returns a wrong value
//!   of the right type with no panic — sort at the call site.
//! - `p` is a fraction in `(0, 1]` (`0.99`, not `99`).
//! - Empty input: `debug_assert!` + a loud `assert!` (an empty sample
//!   set has no percentile, and a silent 0.0 would be a fabricated
//!   measurement).
//!
//! Promoted copies (all delegate here now): the canonical
//! `riir-games-shared/src/stats.rs` (`SeriesStats::p99` + Display
//! support), `riir-engine` `bench_336` (f32 + internal `total_cmp`
//! sort), `riir-rag` `p76_g2c_perf_benchmark` (u64),
//! `riir-games-civ` `bench_392_motivation_goat` (u64), `riir-gpu`
//! `ternary_dispatch_bench` (f64).
//!
//! Pure integer/floating arithmetic on `p` and `n` only — zero deps,
//! zero-cost-unless-invoked, ungated (the `float_order` precedent).

/// Nearest-rank percentile of a pre-sorted (ascending) slice, with the
/// rank's tail support.
///
/// Returns `(value, support)` where `support = n - idx` is the number
/// of samples at or above the returned rank: `1` means "this is the
/// maximum of n ≤ 1/(1-p) samples — the percentile name is decoration",
/// `≥ 10` means the tail has real statistical footing. `p` is a
/// fraction in `(0, 1]`; the rank is `ceil(p·n)` clamped to `1..=n`,
/// 1-based, so `p=1.0` is the maximum with support 1 and `p=0.5` at
/// even `n` is the upper median (the convention every promoted copy
/// already shipped — see `riir-games-shared/src/stats.rs`).
///
/// The rank is deliberately the **ceiling** form: the boundary trap
/// this module exists for is `floor(p·n) == n-1` for every
/// `n ≤ 1/(1-p)`, which reports the maximum under a percentile's name.
/// Callers asserting `p99 < budget` should gate on
/// `support >= 10` (⇒ `n ≥ 1000`) and fall back to an unconditional
/// p50/min budget when the tail is unavailable — the
/// `riir-mmorpg-examples` Issue 093 D1 shape.
