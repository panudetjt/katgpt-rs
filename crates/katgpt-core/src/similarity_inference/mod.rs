//! Similarity Inference — modelless endogenous correlation device for embedded equilibrium.
//!
//! Maintains a **similarity posterior** `ω ∈ (0, 1)` between a focal decision-maker
//! and one partner, updated incrementally from a stream of joint-action observations,
//! plus a **cooperation gate** ([`embedded_best_response`]) that switches from
//! competitive-best-response (Nash) to cooperative-best-response (CCE) when `ω`
//! crosses a payoff-derived threshold. The primitive composes a Bayesian posterior
//! update + a sigmoid cooperation gate + a best-response comparator — zero game
//! semantics, zero entity-kind assumptions, pure closed-form math.
//!
//! # What this is
//!
//! A **modelless inference-time mechanism** distilled from Meulemans et al.
//! (arXiv:2608.03958 §H + §I, *Paradigms of Intelligence*, 4 Aug 2026). The
//! focal agent maintains `ω_T` — its posterior belief that the partner shares
//! its functional identity (same policy / same shard / same committed
//! personality). Observing one's own action played by the partner is a
//! "miracle" under the independent-policy hypothesis but expected under the
//! shared-identity hypothesis, so each such observation pushes `ω` toward 1.
//! When `ω` crosses a payoff-derived threshold, the focal switches from
//! competitive-best-response (defect) to cooperative-best-response (cooperate).
//!
//! # What this is NOT
//!
//! See `katgpt-rs/.plans/526_similarity_inference_primitive.md` and
//! `.research/471` §3 for the full novelty-gate analysis. Summary:
//!
//! - **NOT a new equilibrium concept.** "Embedded equilibrium" reduces to Nash
//!   (decoupled case) or correlated equilibrium (coupled case); both are
//!   already shipped (`CceLp<N,A>`, Plan 295, DEFAULT-ON). The equilibrium
//!   reached by this primitive IS a CCE.
//! - **NOT a replacement for the LP-CCE Moderator (R143/R274).** The moderator
//!   uses an *exogenous* designer-set correlation device `ζ`; this primitive
//!   infers an *endogenous* correlation device `ω` from interaction history.
//!   The two compose: when crowd `ω` crosses threshold, the moderator's
//!   `Γ₀` can switch endogenously. See `.research/471` §3.5.
//! - **NOT a sync-boundary primitive.** `ω` is a per-focal latent scalar that
//!   stays local; only the final cooperate/defect action crosses the sync
//!   boundary as a raw u8 (per AGENTS.md §"Sync Boundary Rule").
//! - **NOT applicable to physical-domain state.** Position, HP, wallet
//!   balance stay raw + synced. `ω` is a *semantic/social* belief about
//!   partner identity, in the latent domain.
//!
//! # Closed-form posterior (paper §H.2)
//!
//! Under a shared-shard hypothesis class with prior `α = P(shared)`:
//!
//! ```text
//! ω_T = α / (α + (1−α) · W(æ_<T))
//! ```
//!
//! where `W(æ_<T) = Π_t P(a_i_t, a_j_t | situation_t)` is the joint-action
//! likelihood under the *independent-policy* marginal. For the canonical
//! "matched-action" evidence (the partner played the same discrete action as
//! the focal in the same situation), each match contributes a factor `1/|A|`,
//! giving `W = |A|^(−T)` and thus:
//!
//! ```text
//! ω_T = α / (α + (1−α) · |A|^(−T))
//! ```
//!
//! For the canonical 2-action Prisoner's Dilemma (`|A|=2`): `ω_T = α / (α +
//! (1−α) · 2^(−T))`, which is the analytical form verified in the G1 test
//! ([`posterior::tests`] `g1_matches_analytical_omega`).
//!
//! `SimilarityPosterior` accumulates `log W` incrementally (no replay of full
//! history) — O(1) per observation regardless of `T`.
//!
//! # Embedded best-response (paper §H.3)
//!
//! Given `ω`, the partner's predicted action distribution is a mixture
//! conditioned on the focal's contemplated action:
//!
//! - If similar (prob `ω`): the partner mirrors the focal's contemplated action.
//! - If independent (prob `1−ω`): the partner plays the exogenous marginal
//!   `q` (default uniform).
//!
//! ```text
//! P̂(a_partner = a' | a_self = a) = ω · δ(a', a) + (1−ω) · q(a')
//! ```
//!
//! The focal picks the action maximizing expected payoff under this coupled
//! predictive model:
//!
//! ```text
//! a* = argmax_a  Σ_{a'}  P̂(a_partner = a' | a_self = a) · R(a, a')
//! ```
//!
//! For canonical PD (R=2, S=0, T=3, P=1) with uniform marginal: the threshold
//! is exactly `ω > 0.5` — verified in [`best_response::tests`]
//! `g8_cooperates_iff_omega_above_half_pd`.
//!
//! # Allocation discipline
//!
//! Per AGENTS.md hot-loop rules:
//! - [`SimilarityPosterior::observe`] is O(1): one fma on `log_w_independent`.
//! - [`SimilarityPosterior::predictive_similarity`] is O(D): one dot-product
//!   + one sigmoid per contemplated action (the continuous-embedding path).
//! - [`embedded_best_response`] is O(|A|²): payoff-matrix scan only.
//! - The discrete-action closed-form path (the G1-validated one) is fully
//!   allocation-free by construction.
//!
//! # Sigmoid, not softmax
//!
//! Per AGENTS.md constraint #2: `ω` is a posterior probability (scalar in
//! `(0,1)`), not a categorical. The cooperation decision is a step function
//! `ω > threshold` (a scalar comparison), not a softmax over actions. Action
//! selection uses plain expected-payoff argmax, not softmax sampling.
//!
//! # Substrate check (substrate-first skill, run before implementation)
//!
//! - **Searched for:** `SimilarityPosterior`, `similarity_inference`,
//!   `embedded_best_response`, `JointActionHistory` across `*.rs` in all 7
//!   repos → zero hits (no prior implementation).
//! - **PayoffTable<N>:** exists in `riir-ai/crates/riir-games-shared/src/payoff/`
//!   but is **combat-specific** (f64, `UnitSpec`, armor classes). Wrong shape
//!   for abstract normal-form games. Plan T1.6 explicitly says "grep first per
//!   substrate-first"; the existing type is domain-bound (combat) — the
//!   abstract game-theoretic matrix needs a separate generic type. We define
//!   [`PayoffMatrix<A>`] locally (f32, no combat semantics).
//! - **Decision:** BUILD NEW (the mechanism is genuinely novel per
//!   `.research/471` §2.3 + §3.5; the closest shipped cousin `CceLp<N,A>`
//!   uses *exogenous* designer correlation, not *endogenous* inferred
//!   correlation).
//! - **Architectural rules checked:**
//!   - Domain classification ✓ — `ω` is semantic/social (latent), not physical.
//!   - Sync boundary ✓ — `ω` stays local; only the final u8 action crosses.
//!   - Sigmoid not softmax ✓ — see above.
//!
//! # Phase 1 GOAT gate (this module)
//!
//! - **G1** — closed-form `ω_T` matches analytical `α/(α+(1−α)·2^(−T))` to f32
//!   epsilon for T=0..50, α=0.1; `embedded_best_response` cooperates iff
//!   `ω > 0.5` for canonical PD.
//! - **G2** — emergent-cooperation PoC (Plan 526 Phase 2, separate file).
//! - **G4** — alloc-free hot path (audited by construction; bench in Phase 4).
