//! Remaining-horizon weighting — the (T−t) Fubini accumulation law and the
//! PFD closed-form `w(t)` schedule (Issue 875 T1 / Research 582).
//!
//! Source: *Probability-Flow Distillation: Exact Wasserstein Gradient Flow
//! for High-Fidelity 3D Generation* (arXiv:2605.09071), Theorem 1: under
//! linear drift `f(x,t) = a(t)·x` with stop-gradient, the expected
//! discrepancy of a uniformly-sampled-`t` partial integration equals the
//! Wasserstein gradient of a time-averaged functional weighted by
//!
//! ```text
//! w(t) = ½ (T−t) · g(t)² · c(t,0)²,    c(t,0) = exp(−∫₀ᵗ a(s) ds)
//! ```
//!
//! The `(T−t)` factor is a Fubini swap on the triangular integration
//! domain: averaging observations taken at uniformly sampled `t` over
//! `[0,T]` gives each partial integral effective weight `(T−s)` — MAXIMUM
//! at low noise (`t → 0`), decaying linearly to EXACTLY ZERO at `t = T`.
//! Corollary encoded here: skipping `t` near `T` is first-order lossless
//! (`w(T) = 0` — the zero-terminal-weight truncation).
//!
//! # Mechanism-distinct neighbors (the substrate-first vocabulary check)
//!
//! - [`crate::tether::horizon_decay`] (and the `hint_regret::memory`
//!   `r̂·σ(−λ·Δt)` family) is PAST-looking staleness fading — weight by
//!   time SINCE an observation. This module is FUTURE-looking — weight by
//!   the REMAINING horizon of an accumulation. Same word, opposite sign of
//!   information.
//! - `set_diffusion_schedule::PositionOffsetSchedule` decides WHERE (which
//!   position) to reveal next; this module decides HOW MUCH an observation
//!   at time `t` contributes to a time-averaged accumulation.
//! - `renoise_ce` averages its `k_draws` FLAT (`sum / k`); Issue 875 T2
//!   wires these weights into that average.
//!
//! # What ships
//!
//! - [`remaining_horizon_weight`] / [`remaining_horizon_weights`]: the
//!   normalized `(T−t)/T` generic law (pure arithmetic, any horizon).
//! - [`remaining_horizon_t_sample`]: the SAMPLING realization of the same
//!   law — the exact inverse CDF of the density `∝ (T−t)` on a sub-range
//!   (Issue 875 T2's draw schedule; one `sqrt`, zero alloc).
//! - [`TimeAnnealRange`] + [`terminal_truncation_ceiling`] /
//!   [`truncated_w_mass_fraction`]: the Issue 875 T3 schedule layer —
//!   iteration-indexed annealing of a SAMPLING RANGE toward low noise
//!   (the paper's `[0.02T, 0.98T] → [0.02T, 0.70T]` late-iteration shape;
//!   state-indexed switching composes with it), plus the zero-terminal-
//!   weight truncation predicate in closed form (`t_cut = T − (T−t_min)·√ε`
//!   — skipping the top of the range discards a known, squared-root-small
//!   fraction of the law's mass).
//! - [`pfd_horizon_weight_at`] / [`pfd_horizon_weights`]: the exact closed
//!   form over a discrete uniform grid (cumulative trapezoid of `a`, one
//!   `exp` per grid point — the offline computation).
//! - [`HorizonWeightTable`]: the closed form frozen into a fixed
//!   `[f32; HORIZON_WEIGHT_GRID]` with a BLAKE3 commitment (the
//!   `katgpt-attn/static_cal.rs` `StaticCalTable` pattern — except this
//!   table is exact closed form, no calibration pass): O(1) nearest-grid
//!   lookup, cross-process reproducible, tamper-evident.
//!
//! # Gates (GOAT, per Issue 875 T5)
//!
//! - **G1** table vs closed-form recompute: bit-identical (`to_bits`) —
//!   pinned in-module (against both the grid fn and an independent f64
//!   oracle within tolerance) and e2e in the root gate
//!   `tests/bench_875_horizon_weights_goat.rs`.
//! - **G2** O(1) lookup vs per-call `exp` recompute (the STRONG baseline:
//!   caller-held cumulative integral) — the root gate via the shared
//!   `ab_timing` harness, median lookup/recompute ≤ 0.5 (≥ 2× faster).
//! - **G3** no-regression: opt-in, default-off — no default-path surface.
//! - **G4** fixed-size table, zero allocation on build and lookup (asserted
//!   under `debug_assertions`/`alloc_tracking` via `crate::alloc`).
//!
//! OPT-IN per the no-default-consumer rule: promotion to default waits for
//! the T2 consumer GOAT ((T−t)-weighted `renoise_ce` averaging).
//!
//! NaN policy: NaN inputs propagate through the pure functions (except
//! [`HorizonWeightTable::w_at_unit`], where the grid clamp sends NaN's
//! saturating cast to index 0 — documented there). This is a weight
//! schedule, not a sync-boundary value; callers on the sync path feed
//! clamped time fractions.
