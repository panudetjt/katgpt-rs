//! Successor-density goal critic — the tabular, modelless CRL extraction
//! (Issue 860 / riir-ai Research 386; arXiv:2206.07568, Eysenbach et al.).
//!
//! In countable `(s, a, g)` domains the contrastive-RL critic's Bayes
//! optimum is a **log density ratio** (paper §4.2, Ma & Collins NCE
//! consistency): `f*(s,a,g) = log( p(s_{t+} = g | s,a) / p(g) )`, where
//! `s_{t+}` is the state observed at a geometrically-drawn future step and
//! `p(g)` is the marginal goal probability. This module ships the closed-form
//! count-based estimator of exactly that ratio — no gradient descent
//! anywhere:
//!
//! ```text
//! score(s,a,g) = ln[ (N(s,a,g)+α) · (N + α·G) / ((N(s,a)+α·G) · (N(g)+α)) ]
//! ```
//!
//! with Laplace smoothing `α > 0` and `G` the number of goal cells. The
//! numerator is the smoothed discounted successor measure
//! `p(s_{t+}=g|s,a)`, the denominator the smoothed marginal `p(g)`; the
//! score is the log-ratio. Per Lemma 4.1 of the paper, `argmax_a` and
//! `argmax_g` over this score are ranking-preserved against the true
//! goal-conditioned value: the `p(g)` term is a goal-only constant that
//! cancels in every `argmax_a` (and symmetrically in `argmax_g` the
//! `(s,a)`-only terms cancel). The conditioning is the paper's own: `s_{t+}`
//! is drawn by CONTINUING along the behavior policy after the observed
//! `(s, a)` — the critic evaluates the data-collection policy's discounted
//! future, and Lemma 4.1's identity is w.r.t. that goal-averaged policy
//! (Research 386 honesty note). That cancellation is an *executable
//! property* here — see [`SuccessorDensityBuilder`] tests and the Bench 818
//! G1 gate — not a claim taken from the paper.
//!
//! # Sampling the successor measure (deterministic, zero-variance)
//!
//! The paper's §3 hindsight sampler draws `t ~ Geom(1−γ)` and relabels the
//! trajectory with goal `g = s_t`. Monte-Carlo draws of that sampler are an
//! unbiased estimator of a deterministic expectation, and a tabular count
//! table gains nothing from the variance. [`SamplerKind::Discounted`] (the
//! default) therefore accumulates the *expectation* directly: transition
//! `(s_i, a_i)` adds `(1−γ)·γ^k` to `N(s_i, a_i, s_{i+1+k})` for every
//! observed future state — via an O(L·G) reverse sweep, not the naive
//! O(L²) per-step walk. [`SamplerKind::CLearning`] applies the paper's
//! App. D classifier blend on top: the next state gets weight
//! `(1−γ)/(2−γ)`, each far-future state `j ≥ 1` steps past the next gets
//! `(1−γ)·γ^(j−1)/(2−γ)`. **The blend
//! re-weights the horizon** (relatively more far mass than the pure
//! geometric measure), so it is the paper's function-approximator training
//! correction and is shipped for parity — it is deliberately NOT the
//! G1-gated default, because exact log-ratio consistency is the property
//! G1 certifies and the blend trades that consistency away by design.
//!
//! Horizons truncate at the trajectory end: unobserved tail mass is simply
//! unassigned (the estimator is unbiased over the observed continuation).
//!
//! # What this is not
//!
//! - Not a trained embedder: the (s, a, g) ids are the caller's
//!   discretization. Continuous observations are upstream's job (riir-train
//!   Plan 413's φ-encoder lane).
//! - Not a density model: only the log-ratio is exposed, because only the
//!   ratio is what ranking needs (Lemma 4.1).
//! - Sparse-cell cold start: unseen cells sit at the α floor — the score
//!   there is the smoothed prior ratio, not a measurement. Consistency is
//!   asymptotic in visits (G1 bounds the Laplace error analytically).
//!
//! # Consumers (pull-gated, filed as their own lanes)
//!
//! riir-ai Issue 991 (per-NPC goal salience `argmax_g`, think-brain only,
//! never synced), riir-train Plan 413 Phase 1 tabular arm (`map_walk`
//! gridworld). Opt-in feature `successor_density_critic`; promotion to
//! default requires the GOAT gate (Bench 818) AND a live consumer.
