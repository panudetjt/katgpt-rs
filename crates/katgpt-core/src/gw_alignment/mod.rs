// Gromov–Wasserstein quotient alignment (Issue 743 / riir-ai Issue 912 T4
// BUILD decision, Research 371) — structure-only cross-space alignment of two
// precomputed distance matrices `D_A` (n×n) and `D_B` (m×m), n,m ≤
// [`GW_MAX`], uniform weights. Unlike `mag::transfer::Wasserstein1d`
// (pointwise ground cost — shared coordinates required) and RSA (index-aligned
// rank correlation — correspondence required), GW aligns using ONLY
// intra-space structure: "do these two probe sets see the same shape of
// distances" with no shared coordinates and no correspondence prior.
//
// Method: first-order stationary point via the product-graph power iteration
// (Peyré/Cuturi/Solomon 2016, "Gromov-Wasserstein Averaging of Kernel and
// Distance Matrices" — conditional-gradient formulation; Mémoli 2011 for the
// distance). The multiplicative reweighting `T ← T ⊙ (D_A·T·D_B)` is the
// power method on the product graph; between power steps the coupling is
// projected back into the uniform-weight transportation polytope by
// alternating row/column normalization (Sinkhorn without entropy). Fixed init
// + fixed iteration count + no RNG ⇒ bit-deterministic (replay-safe by
// construction).
//
// The closed-form loss uses the uniform-coupling identity (row sums 1/n, col
// sums 1/m): `loss = froA2/n² + froB2/m² − 2·⟨T, D_A·T·D_B⟩`. Verified
// against the direct O(n²m²) quadratic form by a unit test.
//
// Latent-only boundary (house rule): the SCORE may cross into a social KG
// triple (encounters/relationships from quotient-space proximity — sanctioned
// by the domain rules); the distance matrices and the coupling plan are
// think-brain-local and never cross any sync surface.
//
// Scope (Issue 743 "explicitly out of scope"): fused GW (needs shared-feature
// costs — none exist across NPCs), entropic/large-n variants (probe sets are
// ≤ 64), TDA/persistent homology (the katgpt-dec TDA lane owns stage-1
// orbits). Uniform weights only.
