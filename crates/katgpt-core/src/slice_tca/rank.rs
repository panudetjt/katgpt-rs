//! Rank selection (T2.1): the EVR-knee deterministic surrogate (default) and
//! an opt-in blocked grid selector.
//!
//! Both selectors are deterministic: fixed evaluation order, sequential
//! blocks, lexicographic `(R_n, R_t, R_k)` ascending tie-breaks. No rayon in
//! any path — the grid is small and the sequential reduction order IS the
//! determinism contract here.
//!
//! # What the blocked selector is (and is not)
//!
//! True held-out prediction CV is STRUCTURALLY IMPOSSIBLE for slice models:
//! every axis indexes free slice parameters (an entity-class slice has one
//! free column per episode; an episode-class loading has one free entry per
//! episode), so a model fit on some episodes predicts ~0 on held episodes at
//! EVERY rank — the CV surface is flat and under-selects by tie-break. Masked
//! fitting would restore a real CV surface but is a hyperparameter curriculum
//! the plan's determinism design deliberately excludes.
//!
//! The opt-in selector is therefore a **blocked structural-fit plateau
//! grid**: split the episodes into contiguous blocks, fit each candidate
//! rank triple on each block independently (the planted structure is present
//! in every block), score by the mean per-block relative residual, and pick
//! the smallest-rank candidate within an ε-plateau of the best score. On
//! clean planted data the plateau starts exactly at the planted ranks —
//! under-ranked fits sit above the plateau, over-ranked fits inside it but
//! larger. It cross-checks the knee surrogate's rank ORDER without claiming
//! held-out predictive validity.
