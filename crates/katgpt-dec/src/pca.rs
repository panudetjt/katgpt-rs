//! PCA global-function layer — DEC aggregates wired into the CA decision
//! function (Plan 591, Research 544).
//!
//! Programmable Cellular Automata (arXiv:2609.06102) measured that ONE global
//! function (count / connectivity) collapses CA iteration counts 3–8× and
//! unlocks tasks purely-local rules cannot solve at all (Zelda 0% → 99%
//! playability). This module is that composition over the shipped DEC
//! substrate: the local rule stays [`stochastic_birth_death_step`] (Plan 454,
//! untouched), and one global aggregate is evaluated ONCE per tick from the
//! pre-sweep state, then handed — together with each cell's own channel slice
//! — to a per-cell [`PcaDecision`].
//!
//! # The paper's constraint, enforced by the API shape
//!
//! The decision NEVER reads raw state beyond its two arguments: the cell's
//! local channel slice (a kernel output) + the tick's [`GlobalScalars`]. There
//! is no parameter by which a decision could reach the whole field — the
//! "global knowledge" channel is exactly one scalar per tick, which is what
//! makes the global function programmable rather than emergent.
//!
//! # The globals ([`PcaGlobalFn`])
//!
//! Each evaluates against the state cochain + complex via the shipped DEC
//! operators:
//!
//! - [`PcaGlobalFn::Betti0`] — connected-component count of the ALIVE support
//!   (channel 0 > 0.5). This is deliberately NOT [`betti_numbers`] — that call
//!   is state-blind (it ranks the FULL complex's boundary matrices; a solid
//!   grid gives β₀ = 1 regardless of which cells are alive). The support-aware
//!   count has no closed form on the subcomplex without restricted Gaussian
//!   elimination, so it ships as an honest O(V + E) union-find scan (the same
//!   "document the scan" standard Phase 2 sets for `LargestComponentSize`).
//! - [`PcaGlobalFn::AliveCount`] — alive-cell count: the paper's COUNT global
//!   (the placement budget). The one arm that is O(1) incrementable on both
//!   births and deaths — the live counter [`step_pca_async`] tracks.
//! - [`PcaGlobalFn::BoundaryFluxMass`] — net morphogen flux across the domain
//!   boundary: flow = d(channel 1), region = ALL faces, so interior edges
//!   cancel by orientation and only boundary edges contribute (Stokes).
//!   `debug_assert!(dim ≤ 3)` — boundary-vs-volume evaluation is a win only
//!   for d ≤ 3 (the curse-of-dimensionality rule; at d ≥ 8 the boundary is
//!   larger than the interior).
//! - [`PcaGlobalFn::BeliefMassDivergence`] — ‖δ₁(flow)‖₁, the Fokker-Planck
//!   conservation-violation mass (same definition as
//!   [`belief_mass_divergence`], computed via [`codifferential_into`] so the
//!   per-tick path stays zero-alloc; equivalence pinned by test).
//! - [`PcaGlobalFn::Codifferential`] — ‖δ₁(flow)‖₂ (RMS-scale). Where the L1
//!   mass counts EVERY small divergence, the L2 norm emphasizes CONCENTRATED
//!   divergence — the clustering signal (Phase 2's crosswalk: which vertices
//!   carry negative δf). A NORM, deliberately: Σ_v δf(v) ≡ 0 (conservation),
//!   so no signed divergence-direction global exists — the arm separates
//!   concentrated vs spread fields by MAGNITUDE only (pinned by the crosswalk
//!   test).
//! - [`PcaGlobalFn::LargestComponentSize`] — largest connected-component
//!   cardinality of the alive support: the one Research 544 crosswalk gap
//!   (b0 gives component COUNT only). Shipped as the SAME O(V + E) union-find
//!   pass as [`PcaGlobalFn::Betti0`], extended with per-root size tracking —
//!   one scan, no harmonic projector (per-component Hodge solves are strictly
//!   worse than O(V + E)), no new deps.
//!
//! # Seed decision
//!
//! [`GlobalTargetGate`] is the construct pure-local CA cannot express: a
//! GLOBAL termination term. When the selected global has crossed `target`
//! (from above or below, per [`StopWhen`]), births stop — the per-cell pass
//! reverts dead→alive flips. Existing alive cells keep running their local
//! death/decay dynamics; only new placements are refused.
//!
//! # Rank/channel contract
//!
//! `field` is the Plan 454 layout: rank-0, dim ≥ 2, channel 0 = alive
//! (binarized 0/1 by the kernel each tick), channel 1 = morphogen. The flow
//! globals read channel 1; [`PcaGlobalFn::Betti0`] reads channel 0.
//!
//! # Zero-alloc
//!
//! All scratch is caller-owned [`PcaScratch`]; every per-tick path uses the
//! `_into` / `_scratched` operator variants. `DecCache` integration is
//! deliberately deferred: no Phase-0 global needs a Hodge decomposition (the
//! flux mass skips the error bound — a per-tick CG solve — by using the
//! mass-only path).
