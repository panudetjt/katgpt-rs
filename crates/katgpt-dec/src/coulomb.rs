//! Training-free Coulomb crowd redistribution (Issue 825 T3, opt-in
//! `coulomb_flow`).
//!
//! Distilled from Bhaskara–Torres–Menon, *Beckmann Transport with a Divergence
//! Constraint* (arXiv:2608.01692) Proposition 2: with the canonical Coulomb
//! field `b = ∇φ`, `Δφ = μ₀ − μ₁`, the first-hitting map of the autonomous flow
//! `Ẋ = b(X)` transports `μ₀ → μ₁` exactly, with **zero training**, provided
//! the target is singular. A zone graph is exactly the atomic case: zones are
//! vertices, current crowd density is `μ₀`, the authored target density is `μ₁`.
//!
//! # What this ships, and what the guarantee actually is
//!
//! The continuous first-hitting argument does not have to be transcribed. On a
//! graph with atomic targets the statement is shorter and it is an identity:
//!
//! 1. `δ(dφ) = Δφ` holds by definition of the rank-0 Laplacian, so solving
//!    `Δφ = μ₁ − μ₀` gives an edge flow `j = dφ` whose divergence is the
//!    density difference **by construction** — mass conservation is not
//!    approximated, it is the equation.
//! 2. Mass balance at a vertex reads `inflow + μ₀ = outflow + μ₁`. So the
//!    fraction of the mass passing through `v` that stops there is
//!    `μ₁(v) / (inflow(v) + μ₀(v))` — [`CrowdRouter::absorb_prob`]. A transit
//!    zone has `μ₁ = 0` and never absorbs; a pure sink has no outflow and
//!    absorbs everything.
//! 3. Routing out of `v` in proportion to the positive outgoing flow then sends
//!    **exactly `j_e`** along edge `e`: the un-absorbed mass is
//!    `avail − μ₁(v) = outflow(v)`, and `outflow(v) · j_e / out_total(v) = j_e`
//!    because `out_total(v) = outflow(v)`. The arrival distribution is `μ₁`,
//!    exactly, as a flow decomposition — no hitting-time argument is needed.
//! 4. A gradient flow is **acyclic** (every step strictly increases `φ`, since
//!    `j_e = φ(head) − φ(tail) > 0` is what makes `e` traversable), so routing
//!    terminates without a step cap.
//!
//! The only error in a per-NPC simulation is therefore **sampling** error,
//! which decays as `1/√N`. That is what the Issue 825 GOAT gate measures, and
//! it is why the gate is a decay rate rather than a single MAE.
//!
//! # Separation of concerns
//!
//! This module owns the math and the routing TABLE. It does not own the RNG:
//! [`CrowdRouter::step`] takes a caller-supplied uniform in `[0, 1)`, so the
//! consumer keeps its own seeded stream. katgpt-dec has zero dependencies and
//! an unseeded global draw is a gated defect class in this workspace
//! (`scripts/global_rng_gate.py`).
